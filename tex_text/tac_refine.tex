%TDES実行列を求めるのは，実用上困難が多い．なぜなら，時間の制約を含んだ仕様を満たさないことがあるし，DESより大規模なシステムだと求めるのに時間がかかる．
%planner とコントローラーがあっていない
A hard problem for a real-time system is synthesis of a  planner or a controller that satisfies the given specification since a model of the system and the specification include temporal constraints.
%この論文では，それらに対するapproachesを提案します．
In this paper, to attack this problem, we propose two approaches to determine a plan for a real-time system modeled by a timed discrete event system (TDES), where a control specification is given by a ticked LTL$_f$ formula whose semantics is defined over a finite state sequence including a special event \textit{tick} that means the elapse of one time unit.
%一つ目は定量的な解を求める方法を提案します．
One approach is to relax the specification by partitioning the specification into \textit{hard constraints} and \textit{soft constraints}.
We give a preference, called \textit{weight}, to each soft constraint and find an execution of the TDES that satisfies all hard constraints and some soft constraints whose combination is prefer to any other one. 
%二つ目は階層型TDESの制御方法
Another approach is to represent a large-scale system by several subsystems, introducing a novel hierarchical model called hierarchical TDES.
Some states in the upper level TDES are refined by the lower level TDESs and time-scales of the upper level TDES and the lower level TDES can be different.
In the hierarchical TDES, rough plans are determined in the upper level TDESs, then detailed plans are determined in the lower level TDESs.
%
The effectiveness of each approach is illustrated through an example of a path planning problem of a mobile robot.

\section{Introduction}
%
%
%
A discrete event system(DES) is useful for the design of a logical high-level controller in many engineering fields such as manufacturing systems, traffic systems, and robotics\cite{CL2008,CSX2018,SSS2013}.
%
For example, a planning problem is an important application of control of DESs \cite{ghallab2016automated}.  Both a considered system and its specification are modeled by a formal manner and the synthesis of a planner is formulated as a control problem.  
Ramadge and Wonham \cite{ramadge1987supervisory} considered a logical control problem called a supervisory control problem, where a specification is given by a formal language, and proposed an algorithm for synthesis of a supervisor.
%
%
However, in practice, it is difficult to determine formal languages that accurately describe desired behaviors of the DES.
So, a temporal logic(TL) formula has been used as a formal description of a control specification in the DES\cite{TW1986,JK2006,SU2018}.

%
Many different TLs have been proposed and their expressivenesses have been studied. 
Among them, the linear temporal logic(LTL) is often used because it can describe many properties such as safety, stability, and progress.
There are mainly two approaches to translate LTL formulas for use.
A basic approach is to translate an LTL formula into an automaton \cite{GV1999}. This approach is widely used for model checking \cite{BK2008}.
Another approach is to translate an LTL formula into its linear encodings \cite{BHJLS2006}. This approach is often used for bounded model checking using a satisfiability (SAT)-solver. 
Moreover, Soukry et al.\cite{S2016} provided an approach of motion planning with LTL specifications which are translated into linear encodings.
%
However, it is a drawback of LTL to need double-exponential time at worst to translate an LTL formula into an automaton.
The cyclic (loop) constraint is needed when we use linear encodings translated from an LTL formula\cite{sahin2019multirobot}. 
Kupferman and Vardi \cite{kupferman2001model} introduced the fragment of LTL, called safe/co-safe LTL. 
This fragment can be interpreted over a bad/good prefix of an infinite execution.
A syntactically co-safe LTL, that is a fragment of safe/co-safe LTL, is often used to give a specification for a planning problem \cite{cho2017cost,feyzabadi2016multi}.
%
However, every fragment of safe/co-safe LTL is restricted in its syntax, so that its expressiveness is poorer than one of LTL.  
To maintain rich expressiveness of LTL, LTL over finite execution, named LTL$_f$, was proposed and synthesis methods based on LTL$_f$ formulas have been studied recently\cite{Zhu2017,li2019sat}.
LTL$_f$ is defined over a finite execution with expressiveness of LTL.
Because of these good properties of LTL$_f$, LTL$_f$ formulas are recently used as specifications for planning problems\cite{camacho2019strong}.

On the other hand, when real-time systems are modeled, we also need to take temporal constraints for the systems into consideration.
For this reason, to represent temporal information of the real-time systems and real-time constraints in their DES models, Brandin et al.\cite{BW1994} formulated timed discrete event systems (TDESs) by a timed transition graph that is a transition graph with state transitions by the event \textit{tick}.
The occurrence of \textit{tick} represents that one unit time has elapsed.
In verification and control of TDESs, control specifications depend not only on logical constraints but also on the timing at which each event occurs. 
Koymans\cite{K1990} proposed TL, called metric TL(MTL),  for an infinite timed state sequence with a function that assigns the time stamp to each state.
The MTL formulas have been used as control specifications for TDESs.
Barbeau et al.\cite{BKD1998} dealt with a synthesis problem of controllers for TDESs with a control specification described by an MTL formula. 
Dhananjayan et al.\cite{DS2014} proposed an MTL specification interface that translates an MTL specification to a finite timed transition graph used in the synthesis of a timed supervisor.

%
In the previous works, the specifications are described by MTL formulas over infinite sequences of the TDESs. 
However, specifications for a planning problem are often given for a finite sequence\cite{camacho2019strong}. 
%
We provided a novel approach of a controller synthesis problem for TDESs, introducing a novel LTL called \textit{ticked LTL}$_f$\cite{KHU2020}.
As with the standard LTL$_f$\cite{Zhu2017}, the formula is interpreted over the finite execution.
In contrast to the standard LTL$_f$, the formula is given as an MTL, where temporal properties are described by counting the number of the event \textit{tick} in the execution of the TDES.
We presented a linear encoding scheme such that the problem can be translated into an integer linear programming (ILP) problem. 
Then, we solve a feasible solution of the ILP problem, so that we have a finite execution of the TDES satisfying the ticked LTL$_f$ specification.
However, there are the following two issues in \cite{KHU2020}.
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemindent}{0.5cm}
\item[(P1)]
%Conflicts among specifications.
In some cases, we have no execution that satisfies a given specification though there may exist executions that satisfy a part of the given specification.
%
\item[(P2)]
%Difficulty to find an execution of a TDES modeling complex behavior
It is computationally difficult to find a finite execution in a long time horizon of a large-scale TDES satisfying many requirements. 
\end{itemize}
%
%
Related works for the above issues are summarized as follows.

%
For (P1), a specification is decomposed into a set of subspecifications and several approaches to the synthesis of a controller that satisfies as many subspecifications as possible have been proposed. 
Alur et al.\cite{AKW2008} presented an automaton-based algorithm.
For each subspecification with a priority and an automaton corresponding with a rank based on its priority is given. 
%
Then, the ``best'' selection of subspecifications are computed.
%
Dimitrova et al.\cite{DGT2018} proposed a method to formulate a weighted partial MaxSAT problem with quantitative specifications described by LTL formulas.
A weighted partial MaxSAT problem has mandatory constraints, called hard constraints, and optional constraints, called soft constraints, and there is a $weight$ for each soft constraint. 
This weight is used as a reward.
Then, the objective of a weighted partial MaxSAT problem is to find the assignment that satisfies all hard constraints and some soft constraints that maximize the sum of the weights.

%
For (P2), two approaches have been studied.
One approach is to model a complex system as the composition of simpler subsystems.
Queiroz and Cury\cite{QC2000} modeled a large-scale system by the composition of some smaller subsystems and a control specification is given for each subsystem.
%
Another approach is to leverage a model with a hierarchical structure.
%
Wong and Wonham\cite{WW1996a,WW1996b} introduced a hierarchical structure by abstracting the original systems using a bottom-up approach.
Gaudin and Marchand\cite{GAUDIN2004131} proposed the methods to model a system with a hierarchical structure using top-down approach and control this hierarchical model.
%
Ngo and Seow\cite{Ngo2018} proposed a control method for a hierarchical model with timing property.
%
Additionally, in \cite{8759973,7497833}, a multilevel DES composed of a finite number of levels was proposed. At each level, there are one or more groups of subsystems modeled by DESs. 
Each subsystem at each level except the lowest level can have one or more subsystems at the next-lower level.

%
%
In this paper, we propose methods to resolve both (P1) and (P2).
For (P1), we translate the ticked LTL$_f$ formula into its linear encodings based on \cite{DGT2018}. We partition a specification described by ticked LTL$_f$ formulas into a mandatory one corresponding to a hard constraint, and some optional ones corresponding to soft constraints.
%
Then, we assign a weight to each soft constraint corresponding to its preference and apply the MaxSAT to determines a set of satisfied soft constraints. 
For (P2), we introduce a hierarchical TDES where some states of the upper level TDES are refined by TDESs.
%
This structure is similar to \cite{GAUDIN2004131,8759973}.
However, we introduce different time-scales in the upper level and the lower level TDESs so that rough control actions in long time horizon are determined using the upper level TDES while detailed ones in short time horizon are determined using the lower level TDESs.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2, we introduce the definition of TDES formulated by Brandin and Wonham\cite{BW1994}.
In Section 3, we review the definition of ticked LTL$_f$.
In Section 4, to deal with (P1), we partition a specification given by an LTL$_f$ formula into a hard constraint and several soft constraints with weights, and formulate a planning problem as a weighted partial MaxSAT problem.
We show an example where we can not find an execution of the TDES in \cite{KHU2020}.
In Section 5, we define a hierarchical TDES.
In Section 6, we present a method to give a specification for each higher level TDES and lower level TDES and to find its execution satisfying the given specification.
In Section 7, we apply the proposed method to a path planning problem of a mobile robot. 
Section 8 provides a summary of the paper and future research directions.

\section{Preliminary}
\subsection{Timed discrete event system}\label{tdes}
%
In this section, we review a timed discrete event system proposed by Brandin and Wonham\cite{BW1994}, where temporal information is modeled by a special event {\sl tick}. First, let us define an untimed discrete event system (DES) by a transition system.
%
\begin{dfn}[Untimed DES] \label{def:G_act}
An untimed DES is a tuple $G_{act}=(S_{act}, \Sigma_{act}, \delta_{act}, s_{init,act}, L_{act}, A_{act})$ where $S_{act}$ is a set of states, $\Sigma_{act}$ is a set of events, $\delta_{act} : S_{act} \times \Sigma_{act} \rightarrow S_{act}$ is a transition function, $s_{init,act}$ is the initial state, $AP_{act}$ is a set of atomic propositions, and $L_{act} : S_{act} \rightarrow 2^{AP_{act}}$ is a labeling function. \qedwhite
\end{dfn}

Next, we incorporate some \textit{timing} properties in $G_{act}$. 
We introduce $l_{\sigma} \in \mathbb{N}$, $u_{\sigma} \in  \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}$ with  $l_{\sigma} \leq u_{\sigma}$ which are called the lower time and the upper time bound, respectively.
Additionally, for integers $m$ and $n$ with $m \leq n$, $[m,\ n]$ denotes a set of integers between $m$ and $n$, that is, $[m,\ n]=\{ m, m+1, \ldots , n\}$.
Then, we assume that each event $\sigma \in \Sigma_{act}$ is enabled during a specified timer interval $[ l_{\sigma},\ u_{\sigma}]$.
%
In particular, the event $\sigma$ is called a prospective ({\sl resp.} remote) event if $u_{\sigma} \in \mathbb{N}$ ({\sl resp.} $u_{\sigma} = \infty$). 
Let $\Sigma_{spe}$ and $\Sigma_{rem}$ $\subseteq \Sigma_{act}$ be the sets of prospective and remote events, respectively.  Note that $\Sigma_{spe} \cup \Sigma_{rem} = \Sigma_{act}$.
Then, we introduce the following timer interval $T_{\sigma}$ for each event $\sigma \in \Sigma_{act}$.
\begin{equation}
\label{T_sigma}
T_{\sigma}= \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}  
\ [ 0,\ u_{\sigma} ]  & \mbox{if } \sigma \in \Sigma_{spe}, \\
\ [ 0,\ l_{\sigma} ] & \mbox{if } \sigma \in \Sigma_{rem}. \\
\end{array} \right.
\end{equation}	 
%
\red{We denote a timed DES (TDES) as the following tuple of a DES $G_{act}$, its unit time $\tick$, and the corresponding timer intervals $T_{\sigma}$ ($\sigma\in \Sigma_{act}$).}
\[
\overline{G}\coloneqq (G_{act},{\tick},\{T_{\sigma} |~\sigma\in \Sigma_{act} \}).
\]
We introduce a special event \textit{tick}, which represents the global clock and will be utilized as an additional event to $\Sigma_{act}$. 
Based on the above definition, a timed DES corresponding to  is defined as follows: 

\begin{dfn}[Timed DES]\label{def:G}
\red{A TDES $\overline{G}$ corresponding to $G_{act}$ is represented by an automaton $G=(S, \Sigma, \delta, s_0,AP, L)$} where $S = S_{act} \times \prod_{\sigma\in \Sigma_{act}} T_{\sigma}$ is a set of states, $\Sigma= \Sigma_{act} \bigcup \{\textit{tick}\}$ is a set of events, $s_0 \in S$ is the initial state where $s_0 = (s_{init,act}, \{ t_{\sigma,0} | \sigma \in \Sigma_{act} \})$ and $t_{\sigma,0}$ is given by
					\begin{equation}
						t_{\sigma, 0} \coloneqq \left\{
						\begin{array}{ll}  
							\ u_{\sigma}  & \mbox{if } {\sigma} \in \Sigma_{spe}, \\
							\ l_{\sigma} & \mbox{if } {\sigma } \in \Sigma_{rem}, \\
						\end{array} \right.
					\end{equation}	
$AP = AP_{act} $ is a set of  atomic propositions and $L  : S \rightarrow 2^{AP} $ is a labeling function, where $L(s)=L_{act}(a)$ for all $s = (a, \{ t_\sigma | \sigma \in \Sigma_{act} \}) \in S$. \qedwhite \end{dfn}
%
The concrete definition of the transition function $\delta:~S\times \Sigma \to S$ is omitted in this paper and the reader is referred to \cite{BW1994} for details.
%
%
%
%
A \textit{finite execution $\pi$ of} $G$ is a finite sequence of alternating states and events
\begin{align}\label{execution}
\pi = s(0)e(1)s(1)\ldots e(\Len) s(\Len), 
\end{align}
where $\Len \in \mathbb{N}_{> 0}$, 
$s(k) \in S$ with $s(0) = s_0$, $\forall k\in[0,\ \Len]$, $e(k') \in \Sigma$, $\forall k' \in [1,\ \Len]$ and $s(l)= \delta(s({l-1}), e({l}))$, $\forall l\in [1,\ \Len]$. 
Here, $\Len$ is called the \textit{length} of $\pi$.
Moreover, the corresponding sequence of states 
\begin{align}
s(0) s(1) \ldots, s(\Len) \notag
\end{align}
is called a \textit{trajectory} of $G$. 
For given \req{execution} and $k\in[0,\ \Len]$, let $\pi(k) = s(k)$, and 
\begin{align}
\pi(k...) = s(k) e({k+1}) s({k+1}) \ldots e({\Len}) s({\Len}), \notag 
\end{align}
i.e., $\pi(k...)$ denotes the $k$-th suffix of $\pi$. Moreover, for given $k, j\in[0,\ \Len]$ with $k\leq j$, let $\pi(k...j)$ be the partial suffix given by 
\begin{align}
\pi(k...j) = s(k) e({k+1}) s({k+1}) \ldots e({j}) s({j}). \notag 
\end{align}
Moreover, for given \req{execution} and $k, j\in [0,\ \Len]$ with $k \leq j \leq \Len$, let $count_\pi(k,j)$ denote the number of the event \textit{tick} included in $\pi(k...j)$.
Note that it takes $count_{\pi}(0, {\Len})+1$ unit times to complete the execution $\pi$ and we call this time \textit{the time for $\pi$}.
%
For example, if $\pi=a,\textit{tick},a,\sigma,b,\textit{tick},a$ with $S=\{a,b\}$ and $\Sigma = \{\sigma\}\cup \{\textit{tick}\}$, we have $count_\pi(0,3) = 2$, $count_\pi (1, 3) = 1$ since $\pi(0...3) = a,\textit{tick},a,\sigma,b,\textit{tick},a$ and $\pi(1...3) = a,\sigma,b,\textit{tick},a$. Note that we have $count_\pi(k, k)=0$, $\forall k \in [ 0, \ \Len ]$, since $\pi(k...k) = s(k)$ and so no events occur in $\pi(k...k)$.
%
%

To focus on states in $S_{act}$, a function $\Pr: S \cup \Sigma \to S_{act} \cup \Sigma $ for $G$ is defined as follows.
\label{def:Pr}
\[
\Pr (x )=\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
s_{act} & \mbox{if }x =(s_{act}, (t_{\sigma})) \in S,  \\ 
x  & \mbox{if } x \in \Sigma , 
\end{array} \right.
\]
where $x  \in S  \cup \Sigma $. 
$\Pr : S \cup \Sigma \to S_{act} \cup \Sigma$ is extended to $\Pr : (S  \cup \Sigma )^* \to  (S_{act} \cup \Sigma )^*$ in the usual way.
%
%
\subsection{ticked linear temporal logic}
We now introduce a fragment of linear temporal logic called ticked LTL$_f$ over a TDES\cite{KHU2020}.
As will be seen below, this formula is interpreted over a finite execution \req{execution}, and provides an extension of the LTL$_f$ formulas\cite{Zhu2017} in the sense that we incorporate some timing properties via the event ${\textit{tick}}$\footnote{By the similar way, we can define ticked LTL, but we consider ticked LTL$_{f}$ in this paper since we deal with planning over a finite length.}.
First, we define its syntax as follows.

\begin{dfn}[Syntax of ticked LTL$_f$]\label{dfn:syntax}
A ticked LTL$_f$ formula over a finite sequence of sets of atomic propositions is recursively defined according to the following grammar: 
\begin{align}
\phi \coloneqq True \ |\ ap\ |\ \lnot \phi\ |\ \phi_1\land \phi_2\ |\ \phi_1U_{[m,n]} \phi_2 ,\notag
\end{align}
where $ap \in AP$, $m$ and $n$ are nonnegative integers with $m\leq n$. \qedwhite
\end{dfn}
%
Additionally, we use the following boolean operators.
\begin{align}
\phi_1 \lor \phi_2 &\coloneqq \lnot(\lnot \phi_1 \land \lnot \phi_2), \notag\\ 
\phi_1 \rightarrow \phi_2 & \coloneqq \lnot \phi_1 \lor \phi_2, \notag\\ 
\phi_1 \leftrightarrow \phi_2 &\coloneqq (\phi_1 \rightarrow \phi_2)\land(\phi_2 \rightarrow \phi_1). \notag
\end{align} 
Moreover, other temporal operators, such as $\Diamond_{[m,n]}$ (future) and $\Box_{[m,n]}$ (globally) are defined by
\begin{align}\label{futureglobal}
\Diamond_{[m,n]} \phi \coloneqq True U_{[m,n]} \phi, \ \Box_{[m,n]} \phi \coloneqq \lnot \Diamond_{[m,n]} \lnot \phi. 
\end{align}
%
Its semantics is defined over a finite execution in \req{execution} and is formally given as follows. 
\begin{dfn}[Semantics of ticked LTL$_f$]
Given a finite execution $\pi = s(0) e(1)$$s(1) \ldots e(\Len) s(\Len)$, the satisfaction of the ticked LTL$_f$ formula $\phi$ for the $k$-th suffix of $\pi$ $(k\in [0,\ \Len])$, denoted as $\pi (k...) \models \phi$, is defined recursively as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item 	$\pi(k...) \models True$,
\item 	$\pi(k...) \models ap$ if and only if $ap \in L(\pi(k))$,
\item 	$\pi(k...) \models \lnot \phi$ if and only if $\pi(k...) \not\models \phi$,
\item 	$\pi(k...) \models \phi_1\land \phi_2$ if and only if $\pi(k...) \models \phi_1 \land \pi(k...)\models \phi_2$,
\item 	$\pi(k...) \models \bigcirc\phi$ if and only if $\pi(k+1...) \models \phi$,
\item 	$\pi(k...) \models \phi_1U_{[m,n]} \phi_2$ if and only if there exists $j \in [k ,\ \Len]$ such that $m \leq count_\pi(k, j) \leq n$, $\pi(j...) \models \phi_2$ and $\pi(i...) \models \phi_1$, $\forall i \in [k,j-1]$. \qedwhite
	\end{itemize}
	\end{dfn}

Intuitively, the formula $\phi_1 U_{[m,n]}  \phi_2$ indicates that $\phi_1$ holds true until $\phi_2$ holds true during the interval such that the number of ticked events is between $m$ and $n$. 
%Note that we do not include the operator $\bigcirc$ (next) in the \red{syntax since, by the meaning of tick,} $F_{[1,1]}$ can be used as $\bigcirc$. 
We denote by $\pi \models \phi$ if and only if $\pi (0...) \models \phi$.

\begin{exa}
Consider the following finite execution.
\begin{align}
\pi=a,\textit{tick},a,\sigma,b,\textit{tick},a \notag
\end{align}
and a ticked LTL$_f$ formula $\phi=ap_1 U_{[1,3]} ap_2$ with $AP=\{ap_1,ap_2\}$, $S=\{a,b\}$, $\Sigma=\{\sigma\}\cup\{\textit{tick}\}$ and $L(a)=\{ap_1\},\ L(b)=\{ap_2\}$. Then, $\pi(0...) (= a,\textit{tick},a,\sigma,b,\textit{tick},a)$ satisfies $\phi$, since $a$ holds true until $b$ holds true while the number of \textit{tick} counted from $\pi(0)$ is $1$, i.e., $count_{\pi}(0, 2) = 1 \in[ 1,\ 3]$. However, $\pi (1...) (= a,\sigma,b,\textit{tick},a)$ does \textit{not} satisfy $\phi$, since $b$ holds true while the number of \textit{tick} counted from $\pi(1)$ is $0$, i.e., $count_{\pi}(1, 2) = 0 \notin [1, 3]$. \qedwhite 
\end{exa}


\subsection{Encoding of constraints}\label{encode}
%
We review a method that encodes a finite trajectory of \red{the automaton} $G=(S, \Sigma, \delta, s_{init}, AP, L)$, where $s_{init} \in S= \{s_1, s_2 \ldots, s_{N} \}$, the counting function $count_\pi$, and the ticked LTL$_f$ formula $\phi$ using inequality and equality constraints.
This method is an extension of the method proposed by \cite{BHJLS2006}.  See \cite{KHU2020} for its detail.
%
\subsubsection{Automaton of TDES}
Let $\pi_{G}=s(0)e(1)s(1) \ldots e(\Len)s(\Len)$ be \red{an execution of the automaton $G$ of the TDES $\overline{G}$}, where $\Len$ is the length of $\pi$ and $s(0)=s_{init}$.
We introduce $\Len+1$ binary vectors $w_G (k)=[w_{G,1} (k), w_{G,2} (k) , \ldots , w_{G,|S|} (k) ]^{\mathsf{T}} \in \{0, 1\}^{|S|}$ for $k\in [0,\ \Len]$ to represent the $k$-th state $s(k)$ of $\pi$ as follows.
\[
w_{G,i}(k)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
1 & \mbox{if } s(k)=s_i, \\
0 & \mbox{otherwise.}
\end{array} \right.
\]
Additionally, we introduce a binary vector $w_{G,s_0}=[w_{G,s_0,1} (k), w_{G,s_0,2} (k) , \ldots , w_{G,s_0,|S|} (k) ]\in \{0, 1\}^{|S|}$ to represent the initial state of $G$ as follows.
\[
w_{G,s_0,i}=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
1 & \mbox{if } s_0=s_i, \\
0 & \mbox{otherwise.}
\end{array} \right.
\]

Denoted by $A_G \in \{0, 1\}^{|S| \times |S|}$ is the \textit{transition matrix} of  $G$, where the $(i,j)$-th element $A_{G,i,j}$ of $A_G$ is defined by
\[
A_{G,i,j}=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
1 & \mbox{ if } \exists \sigma \in \Sigma.\ s_j=\delta(s_i, \sigma), \\
0 & \mbox{otherwise.}
\end{array} \right.
\]
 

Then, we have the following encoding.
\begin{equation}\label{w}
w_G(k+1) \leq A_{G}^{\mathsf{T}} w_G(k), \ {1}^\mathsf{T} _{|S|} w_G(k) =1, 
\end{equation}
where ${1}_{|S|}$ is the $|S|$-dimensional vector whose all elements are 1.
%
%

We introduce the following variables $z_{G,e}(k)$, $k\in[1,\ \Len]$ which indicates if $e(k)$ is the event \textit{tick} or not.
\[
z_{G,e}=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
1 & \mbox{ if } e(k)=tick, \\
0 & \mbox{otherwise.}
\end{array} \right. .
\]
We introduce two binary vectors $\alpha=[\alpha_1, \alpha_2,\ldots , \alpha_{|S|}]^{\mathsf{T}} \in \{0, 1\}^{{|S|}}$ and  $\beta=[\beta_1, \beta_2,\ldots , \beta_{|S|}]^{\mathsf{T}} \in \{0, 1\}^{{|S|}}$ defined by

\begin{eqnarray*}
\alpha_{i}&=&\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
1 & \mbox{ if } \delta(s_i, tick)!, \\
0 & \mbox{otherwise,}
\end{array} \right.\\
\beta_{i}&=&\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
1 & \mbox{ if } \exists s_j. s_i=\delta(s_j,tick)!, \\
0 & \mbox{otherwise.}
\end{array} \right.
\end{eqnarray*}
Then, $z_{G,e}(k)=1$ if and only if
\begin{align}%\label{count_constraint}
\alpha^\mathsf{T} w_G (k-1) = 1 \wedge \beta^\mathsf{T} w_G (k) =1. \notag 
\end{align}
Thus, $z_{G,e}(k)=1$ if and only if the following equations hold.
\begin{align}
z_{G,e} (k) &\leq \alpha^\mathsf{T} w_G (k-1),\label{zek1} \\
z_{G,e} (k) &\leq \beta^\mathsf{T} w_G (k), \label{zek2}  \\
z_{G,e} (k) & \geq -1 + \alpha^\mathsf{T} w_G (k-1) + \beta^\mathsf{T} w (k).\label{zek3}
\end{align}

Then, denoted by $SYS(G)$ is a set of constraints (\ref{w})-(\ref{zek3}) \red{for the automaton of the TDES $\overline{G}$.}


\subsubsection{Counting function}
For each $k, j \in [0,\ \Len]$ with $k\leq j$, let $c_{\pi_G} (k, j) \in \mathbb{N}$ be an integer variable that represents how many times the event \textit{tick} occurs in $\pi_G(k...j)$, i.e., $c_{\pi_G}(k,j) = m$ if and only if $count_{\pi_G}(k,j) = m$. 
Using $z_{G,e} (k)\, (k \in [0,\ \Len])$, we have
\begin{equation}\label{ckj}
c_{\pi_G} (k, j) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
\displaystyle{\sum^j _{i = k+1} z_{G,e} (i)} & \mbox{if } k<j , \\
0 & \mbox{if } k=j.
\end{array} \right. 
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Ticked LTL$_f$ formula}\label{encLTL}
%   
We introduce $\Len+1$ binary variables $z_{\varphi}(k) \in \{0,1\}$ for $k \in [0,\ \Len]$ such that $z_{\varphi}(k)=1$ if and only if $\pi_G (k, \Len)$ satisfies $\varphi$.
Then, the linear encoding corresponding to the satisfaction of  the ticked LTL$_f$ formula $\varphi$ is recursively given as follows.
%
%

\textit{Atomic proposition:} Let $\varphi = ap \in AP$ and $v \in \{0, 1\}^{|S|}$ be a binary vector such that $v_i = 1$ (the $i$-th component of $v$ is $1$) if and only if $ap \in L(s_i)$. Then, the satisfaction of the formula $\varphi$ is encoded as follows: 
\begin{align}
v^\mathsf{T} {w_G}(k) &\geq z_\varphi (k),\notag\\
v^\mathsf{T} {w_G}(k) &< z_\varphi (k)+1. \notag
\end{align}

\textit{Negation:} Let $\varphi = \neg \varphi$. Then, the satisfaction of $\varphi$ is encoded as 
\begin{align}\notag
z_\varphi (k) = 1 - z_{\varphi'} (k). 
\end{align}

\textit{Conjunction:} Let $\varphi = \bigwedge^{\Len} _{\ell=1} \varphi_\ell$. Then, 
\begin{align}
\label{translate_con}
z_\varphi (k) &\leq z_{\varphi_\ell} (k),\ \forall \ell \in [1,\ \Len], \notag \\ 
z_\varphi (k) & \geq 1-\Len + \sum_{\ell=1}^{\Len} z_{\varphi_\ell} (k). \notag
\end{align}

\textit{Disjunction:} Let $\varphi = \bigvee^{\Len} _{\ell=1} \varphi_\ell$. 
Then, 
\begin{align}
z_\varphi (k) &\geq z_{\varphi_\ell} (k),\ \forall \ell \in [1,\ \Len], \notag \\ 
z_\varphi (k) & \leq \sum_{\ell=1}^{\Len} z_{\varphi_\ell} (k). \notag
\end{align}
%%%
With a slight abuse of notation, Boolean operators are used for binary variables. For example, when we consider $\varphi = \bigwedge^\Len _{\ell=1} \varphi_\ell$, we write $z_\varphi = \bigwedge^{\Len} _{\ell=1} z_{\varphi_\ell}$. % instead of \req{translate_con}. 
Then, we describe the translation of the temporal operator \textit{until} with this notation.
%%%

\textit{Until:} 
Let $\varphi = \varphi_1 U_{[m,n]} \varphi_2$. We introduce binary variables $\underline{z}_m (k, j), \overline{z}_n (k, j) \in \{0, 1\}$, for $k, j \in [0,\ \Len]$ with $k\leq j$,
such that $\underline{z}_m (k,j) = 1$ ({\sl resp.} $\overline{z}_n (k, j) = 1$) if and only if $m \leq c_{\pi_G} (k, j)$ ({\sl resp.} $c_{G_e}(k,j) \leq n$). Then, we have 
\begin{eqnarray}
m - M_c &\leq c_{\pi_G} (k, j) - M_c \underline{z}_m(k,j) &\leq m - \epsilon, \notag\\ 
{n} + \epsilon  &\leq  c_{\pi_G} (k, j) + M_c \overline{z}_n(k,j) &\leq {n}+M_c, \notag
\end{eqnarray}
where $M_c$ is a sufficiently large number satisfying $M_c >n$ and $\epsilon$ is a sufficiently small number satisfying $\epsilon<1$.
Then, the satisfaction of $\varphi$ is encoded as 
\begin{align}%\label{until1}
z_\varphi (k) = \bigvee^{\Len} _{j=k} z_\varphi (k, j),
\end{align}
where 
\begin{align}%\label{until2}
z_\varphi (k, j) = \overline{z}_n (k,j) \wedge  \underline{z}_m (k,j) \wedge z_{\varphi_2} (j) \wedge \left(\bigwedge^{j-1} _{\ell=k} z_{\varphi_1} (\ell) \right).  \notag 
\end{align}

The encodings for $\Diamond_{[m,n]}$ and $\Box_{[m,n]}$are similarly done from  \req{futureglobal} and are thus omitted. 
%

Denoted by $LTL(\varphi)$ is the set of constraints obtained by the above encoding for the ticked LTL$_f$ formula $\varphi$.

When we introduce the soft constraints to a planning problem, we have two performance indexes $J_{time}$ and $J_{soft}$ for a plan: $J_{time}$ indicates how fast the plan is completed and $J_{soft}$ indicates how large the sum of the preferences of the satisfied soft constraints is.
Then, A preferable plan minimizes $J_{time}$ and maximizes $J_{soft}$ simultaneously, which causes a trade-off between the indexes. To represent the trade-off, we introduce the following objective function $J_{\kappa}$ with $0 \leq \kappa \leq 1$.
\begin{equation}
J_{\kappa}=-\kappa J_{time} + (1-\kappa) J_{soft}.
\end{equation}
The parameter $\kappa$ represents which index is more important.
Then, roughly speaking, we consider the following optimal planning problem:
Given a TDES $G$ with the initial state $s_0$, the length $\Len>0$ of the plan,  a hard constraint described by a ticked LTL$_f$ formula $\phi$, $N$ soft constraints described by the ticked LTL$_f$ formula $\psi_{i}$ and the weight $w_i$ for $i\in[1,\ N]$, and the objective function $J_\kappa$,
find a plan $\pi$ with the length $\Len$ for $G$ that maximizes the objective function $J_{\kappa}$ subject to $\pi \models \phi$.

In the following, we consider the following objective function based on the binary variables used in the encoding of a trajectory of $G$ and the ticked LTL$_f$ formula $\psi_{i}$.
\begin{align}\label{j1}
J_\kappa= 
-\kappa\sum_{k=1}^{\Len}z_e(k) + (1-\kappa)\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i}\cdot z_{\psi_{i}(0)}, 
\end{align}
where $z_e(k)=1$ means that the $k$-th event of the trajectory is $tick$ and $z_{\psi_{i}(0)}=1$ means that the plan satisfies the soft constraint $\psi_{i}$.
Note that $J_{time}=\sum_{k=1}^{\Len}z_e(k)$ indicates the number of the event $tick$ in the trajectory corresponding to the plan and
$J_{soft}=\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i}\cdot z_{\psi_{i}(0)}$ is the sum of the preferences of the soft constraints satisfied by the plan.
Then, we formulate the optimal planning problem as follows.


%
\begin{pbm}\label{pbm2}
Find optimal binary vectors $\red{w_G}(k) \in \{0, 1 \}^N$ \red{$(k\in[0,~ \Len])$} for the following ILP problem {\bf ILP\ref{pbm2}}, which correspond to an optimal plan.
\begin{eqnarray}
\mbox{\bf ILP\ref{pbm2}}: &\mbox{maximize }&J_\kappa \notag \\
&\mbox{subject to }&SYS(G) \notag \\
&& LTL(\phi),\notag \\
&& LTL(\psi_i) \  {\rm{for\ each\ }}  i \in [1,\ N], \notag\\
&& w_G(0)=w_{s_0}, \notag \\
&&z_{\phi} (0) = 1, \notag
\end{eqnarray}
where $w_{s_0} \in \{0, 1 \}^N$ is the binary vector corresponding to the initial state $s_0$.

The procedures to solve \rpbm{pbm2} is described in Algorithm 1 in detail.

\subsection{Example}\label{sec:sim1}
%
In this section, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by a simulation of a path planning problem for a mobile robot.
\red{The simulation was run by a machine with AMD Ryzen9 5950X and 128GB memory, and the solver Gurobi\footnote{https://www.gurobi.com/} was used to compute an optimal solution of this ILP problem.}

We consider the system whose logical behavior is modeled by an untimed DES $G_{act}$ shown in \rfig{sim1}.
In the figure, each node represents the state of the system, and each edge represents the transition between them. 
The symbol $(e,l_e,u_e)$ near each edge represents the event  $e\in\Sigma_{act}$ associated with the edge, the lower time of $e$, and the upper time of $e$, respectively. The element in parentheses next to $s_i$ represents atomic propositions assigned to $s_i$ for $i\in[0,~5]$.
The initial state is $s_0$.
%
Based on the above definitions, the corresponding timed DES $G$ is constructed according to \rdef{def:G}. 
%
\subsubsection{Simulation result}
%
We consider the following hard constraint, and soft constraints and their weight.
\begin{align}
\phi=&\F{0,\Len}p_{fin},\notag \\
\Psi 
=&\{
(\psi_1=\G{0,\Len}(\lnot p_s),3),~
(\psi_2=\F{0,\Len}p_3,1),\notag \\
&~~(\psi_3=\F{0,\Len}p_4,1),~
(\psi=((\lnot p_4) \U{0,\Len} p_3,2)
\}.\notag
\end{align}
%
We use Gurobi to compute an optimal execution that optimizing the objective function $J_\kappa$. 
Let $\Len=20$. We compute optimal executions $\pi^1$, $\pi^2$, and $\pi^3$ with $\kappa=0.01,0.5,1$, respectively, such that $\Pr(\pi^1)$, $\Pr(\pi^2)$, and $\Pr(\pi^3)$ are given by
\begin{align}
\Pr(\pi^1)=&
s_0,\ttick,s_0,\ttick,s_0,e_{03},s_3,\ttick,s_3,\ttick,\notag\\
&s_3,e_{34},s_4,\ttick,s_4,e_{40},s_0,e_{01},s_1,\notag\\
&\ttick,s_1,e_{12},s_2,\ttick,s_2,e_{25},s_5,\ldots,s_5\notag\\
\Pr(\pi^2)=&
s_0,\ttick,s_0,\ttick,s_0,e_{03},s_3,\ttick,\notag\\
&s_3,\ttick,s_3,e_{35},s_5,\ldots,s_5\notag \\
\Pr(\pi^3)=&s_0,e_{01},s_1,\ttick,s_1,e_{12},s_2,\ttick,s_2,e_{25},s_5,\ldots,s_5\notag
\end{align}
%
The time for $\pi^1$, $\pi^2$, and $\pi^3$ are 7, 4, and 2 [\tick], respectively.
The sum of weight of soft constraints satisfied by $\pi^1$, $\pi^2$, and $\pi^3$ are 4, 3, and 0.
The results of executions are shown that the combination of satisfied soft constraints is changed when the value of $\kappa$ is changed while satisfying the hard constraint.

\section{Planning under ticked LTL$_f$ constraints}\label{sec4}
%
We consider a planning problem for a system modeled by a TDES $G$.
A specification for this plan is given by a ticked LTL$_f$ formula introduced in the previous section. 
In general, however, no execution satisfying the specification may exist though we find an execution that partially satisfies it. 
One approach to relax the specification is to partition the formula into a mandatory subformula called a hard constraint and several optional subformulas called soft constraints, where the former is the indispensable requirement and the latter describes a requirement preferable to be satisfied.  
Some specifications for the plan are represented as soft constraints.  
We assign to each soft constraint a weight that indicates the preference for its satisfaction and propose a method for finding a solution.

%
\red{
\subsection{Problem formulation}\label{sec:pbm}
}
%
We assume that there are one hard constraint $\phi$ and $N$ soft constraints $\psi_1,...,\psi_N$. 
When we introduce soft constraints to a planning problem, we consider the following points.
\begin{itemize}
\item
There are combinations of satisfaction of soft constraints.
\item
There is a trade-off between the shortness of the time for the result of(resulting) execution and the sum of weights of the soft constraints satisfied by the execution.
\end{itemize}

For the first point, we consider the case where a preference on the satisfiability of soft constraints exists.
To explain the preference of the satisfactions of the soft constraints, we introduce a positive constant called $weight$ for each soft constraint.
For each soft constraint $\psi_n (n \in [1,N])$, its weight is denoted by $weight_n$. The larger sum of weights of satisfied soft constraints is preferred.
We denote a set of pairs of a soft constraint and its weight by $\Psi=\{(\psi_n,w_n)|~n\in[1,~N]\}$.

For the second point, 
the combination of satisfaction of soft constraints is changed if we change the ratio of the importance of the time for the result of execution to that(=the importance) of the sum of weights of the satisfied soft constraints.
For example, if the time for the result of execution is important, many soft constraints may not be satisfied. 
On the other hand, if we focus on the sum of weights of the satisfied soft constraints, many soft constraints can be satisfied, while it will take more time.
Let $\kappa(0\leq\kappa\leq1)$ be the ratio of the importance of the time for the result of execution to the sum of weights of the satisfied soft constraints.
Then, we set an objective function 
%$J_\kappa(z_e(0),\ldots z_e(\Len),z_{\psi_1},\ldots,z_{\psi_N})$
$J_\kappa$
to represent these two points and we formulate the problem where the specification is given by a hard constraint and several soft constraints to find an optimal execution of the TDES as follows.
%
\begin{pbm}\label{pbm2}
Given a TDES $G$, a hard constraint given by a ticked LTL$_f$ formula $\phi$, $N$ soft constraints given by ticked LTL$_f$ formulas $\psi_{n}$ and their weights $w_n$ for $n\in[1,\ N]$, the length $\Len>0$, and the objective function $J_\kappa$,
find a finite execution $\pi$ of $G$ such that
\begin{eqnarray}
&\mbox{max: }&J_\kappa \notag \\
&\mbox{subject to: }&\pi \models \phi\mbox{, and transition lows of }G\notag
\end{eqnarray}
\qedwhite
\end{pbm}
%
If there is no solution of the ILP problem, i.e., we can not find an execution of $G$ under constraints $\phi$, we denote $\pi=\bot$.
%
To solve \rpbm{pbm2}, we use the following linear encoding schema presented in \cite{KHU2020}.
%
\subsection{Encoding of constraints}\label{encode}
%
We translate a finite trajectory of the TDES $G$, the counting function $count_\pi$, and the ticked LTL$_f$ formula $\phi$ into a set of inequality and equality constraints that can be solved by an integer linear programming (ILP) problem.
The method to translate the ticked LTL$_f$ formula is proposed by extending the method proposed by \cite{BHJLS2006}. Details for the encodings are described below. 
%
\subsubsection{Trajectory of $G$}
To encode the trajectory of $G$, we denote by $A \in \{0, 1\}^{N \times N}$ with $N=|S|$ the \textit{adjacency matrix} of the graph in accordance with $G$, i.e., letting $S = \{s_1, ..., s_{N}\}$, we have $A_{i,{j_i}} = 1$ (the $(i,{j_i})$-component of $A$ is $1$) if and only if there exists $\sigma \in \Sigma$ such that $s_j \in \delta(s_i, \sigma)$, and $0$ otherwise. Moreover, we introduce $\Len+1$ binary vectors $w (k) \in \{0, 1\}^{N}$, $k\in [0,\ \Len]$ to represent the state of $G$ at $k$, where, for each $k \in [0,\ \Len]$, the vector $w(k)$ includes only one non-zero component. That is, if $\pi$ is given by \req{execution}, we have $w_i (k) = 1$ (the $i$-th component of $w(k)$ is $1$) if and only if $s(k) = s_i$, and $0$ otherwise. The trajectory of the states can be then encoded as follows: 
\begin{equation}\label{w}
w(k+1) \leq A^\mathsf{T} w(k), \ {1}^\mathsf{T} _N w(k) =1, 
\end{equation}
where ${1}_N$ is the $N$-dimensional vector whose all elements are 1.
%
%
\subsubsection{Counting function}
Let $c (k, j) \in \mathbb{N}$ for $k, j \in [0,\ \Len]$ with $k\leq j$ be integer variables that represent the number of \textit{tick} events in
%
%
$\pi(k...j)$, i.e., $c(k,j) = m$ if and only if $count_\pi(k,j) = m$. The $c(k,j)$ represents an ILP problem constraint as follows. First, we introduce $\Len$ binary variables $z_e (k) \in \{0, 1\}$, for $k\in[1,\ \Len]$ in order to represent the occurrence of \textit{tick} in the sequence of events, i.e., if $\pi$ is given by \req{execution}, we have $z_e(k) = 1$ if and only if $e(k) = \textit{tick}$. Using $z_e (k)$, $k \in [0,\ \Len]$, $c(k, j)$ is then given by
\begin{align}\label{ckj}
c (k, j) =   \sum^j _{i = k+1} z_e (i),
\end{align}
for $k, j \in [0,\ \Len]$ with $k < j$, and $c (k, k) = 0$, $\forall k\in[0,\  \Len]$. 
The variables $z_e(k)$, $k\in[1,\ \Len]$ encodes whether $e(k)$ is the event \textit{tick} or not. First, let $\alpha \in \{0, 1\}^{N}$ be a binary vector such that $\alpha_i = 1$ (the $i$-th component of $\alpha$ is $1$) if and only if $\delta (s_i, \textit{tick}) !$ (i.e., the event \textit{tick} occurs at $s_i$). Moreover, let $\beta \in \{0, 1\}^{N}$ be a binary vector such that $\beta_i = 1$ (the $i$-th element of $\beta$ is $1$) if and only if there exists $s_{j} \in S$ such that $s_i = \delta (s_{j}, \textit{tick})$ (i.e., there exists a state that can transit to $s_i$ by the occurrence of the event \textit{tick}).

Then, $z_e(k)=1$ if and only if
\begin{align}%\label{count_constraint}
\alpha^\mathsf{T} w (k-1) = 1 \wedge \beta^\mathsf{T} w (k) =1. \notag 
\end{align}
Thus, $z_e(k)=1$ if and only if the following equations hold.
\begin{align}
z_e (k) &\leq \alpha^\mathsf{T} w (k-1),\label{zek1} \\
z_e (k) &\leq \beta^\mathsf{T} w (k), \label{zek2}  \\
z_e (k) & \geq -1 + \alpha^\mathsf{T} w (k-1) + \beta^\mathsf{T} w (k).\label{zek3}
\end{align}
%
\subsubsection{Ticked LTL$_f$ formula}\label{encLTL}
%   
We introduce $\Len+1$ binary variables $z_{\phi}(k) \in \{0,1\}$ for $k \in [0,\ \Len]$ such that $z_{\phi}(k)=1$ if and only if $\pi (k...)$ satisfies $\phi$.
We represent $\textit{ILP}(\phi)$ as the constraints of an ILP problem for the ticked LTL$_f$ formula $\phi$.
The encodings corresponding to the specification $\phi$ can be recursively given as follows.
%
%

\textit{Atomic proposition:} Let $\phi = ap \in AP$ and $v \in \{0, 1\}^N$ be a binary vector such that $v_i = 1$ (the $i$-th component of $v$ is $1$) if and only if $ap \in L(s_i)$. Then, the satisfaction of the formula $\phi$ is encoded as follows: 
\begin{align}
v^\mathsf{T} w(k) &\geq z_\phi (k),\notag\\
v^\mathsf{T} w(k) &< z_\phi (k)+1. \notag
\end{align}

\textit{Negation:} Let $\phi = \neg \psi$. Then, the satisfaction of $\phi$ is encoded as 
\begin{align}\notag
z_\phi (k) = 1 - z_\psi (k). 
\end{align}

\textit{Conjunction:} Let $\phi = \bigwedge^{\Len} _{\ell=1} \psi_\ell$. Then, 
\begin{align}
\label{translate_con}
z_\phi (k) &\leq z_{\psi_\ell} (k),\ \forall \ell \in [1,\ \Len], \notag \\ 
z_\phi (k) & \geq 1-\Len + \sum_{\ell=1}^{\Len} z_{\psi_\ell} (k). \notag
\end{align}

\textit{Disjunction:} Let $\phi = \bigvee^{\Len} _{\ell=1} \psi_\ell$. 
Then, 
\begin{align}
z_\phi (k) &\geq z_{\psi_\ell} (k),\ \forall \ell \in [1,\ \Len], \notag \\ 
z_\phi (k) & \leq \sum_{\ell=1}^{\Len} z_{\psi_\ell} (k). \notag
\end{align}
%%%
With a slight abuse of notation, Boolean operators are used for binary variables. For example, when we consider $\phi = \bigwedge^\Len _{\ell=1} \psi_\ell$, we write $z_\phi = \bigwedge^{\Len} _{\ell=1} z_{\psi_\ell}$. % instead of \req{translate_con}. 
Then, we describe the translation of the temporal operator \textit{until} with this notation.
%%%

\textit{Until:} 
Let $\phi = \psi_1 U_{[m,n]} \psi_2$. We introduce binary variables $\underline{z}_m (k, j), \overline{z}_n (k, j) \in \{0, 1\}$, for $k, j \in [0,\ \Len]$ with $k\leq j$,
such that $\underline{z}_m (k,j) = 1$ ({\sl resp.} $\overline{z}_n (k, j) = 1$) if and only if $m \leq c (k, j)$ ({\sl resp.} $c(k,j) \leq n$). That is, $c(k, j)$ is encoded as 
\begin{eqnarray}
m - M_c &\leq c (k, j) - M_c \underline{z}_m(k,j) &\leq m - \epsilon, \notag\\ 
\red{(n-1)} + \epsilon  &\leq  c (k, j) + M_c \overline{z}_n(k,j) &\leq \red{(n-1)}+M_c, \notag
\end{eqnarray}
where $M_c$ is a sufficiently large number satisfying $M_c >n$ \red{and $\epsilon$ is a sufficiently small number satisfying $\epsilon<1$.} 
Then, the satisfaction of $\phi$ is encoded as 
\begin{align}%\label{until1}
z_\phi (k) = \bigvee^{\Len} _{j=k} z_\phi (k, j),
\end{align}
where 
\begin{align}%\label{until2}
z_\phi (k, j) = \overline{z}_n (k,j) \wedge  \underline{z}_m (k,j) \wedge z_{\psi_2} (j) \wedge \left(\bigwedge^{j-1} _{\ell=k} z_{\psi_1} (\ell) \right).  \notag 
\end{align}

The encodings for $\Diamond_{[m,n]}$ and $\Box_{[m,n]}$are similarly done from  \req{futureglobal} and are thus omitted. 
%
%
\red{\subsection{Optimization problem}}
%
To represent two points in \rsec{sec:pbm}, we introduce(set) the following objective function. 
\begin{align}\label{j1}
J_\kappa= 
-\kappa\sum_{k=1}^{\Len}z_e(k) + (1-\kappa)\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i}\cdot z_{\psi_{i}(0)}, 
\end{align}
Then, we convert \rpbm{pbm2} into the following ILP problem by using the encodings considered in Section \ref{encode}. 
%Then, we find an execution that satisfies the hard constraint and some soft constraints such that the sum of weights of the satisfied soft constraints is maximized with the considering the shortness of time. 
%
%Then, based on the above setting about soft constraints and their weights, 
%
%
\begin{eqnarray}
&\mbox{max: }&J_\kappa \notag \\
&\mbox{subject to: }&\req{w}-\req{ckj},\ \textit{ILP}(\phi),\ \textit{ILP}(\psi_i),\notag\\
&&z_{\phi} (0) = 1, {\rm{for\ each\ }}  i \in [1,\ N].\notag
\end{eqnarray}
%
%
Note that $\kappa$ represents the trade-off between the time for the result of execution and the sum of weight of satisfied soft constraints.
For example, we find the execution with the shortest time without considering soft constraints when $\kappa=1$, and the execution that maximizes the sum of weights of satisfied soft constraints is found without considering the time when $\kappa=0$.

The procedures to solve \rpbm{pbm2} is described in Algorithm 1 in detail.

In order to demonstrate effectiveness to partition the formula in \rpbm{pbm2}, 
we show an illustrative example of path planning and discuss how the optimal path depends on the weights for the soft constraints in the following section.
%

%
\subsection{Example}\label{sec:sim1}
%
In this section, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by a simulation of a path planning problem for a mobile robot.
\red{The simulation was run by a machine with AMD Ryzen9 5950X and 128GB memory, and the solver Gurobi\footnote{https://www.gurobi.com/} was used to compute an optimal solution of this ILP problem.}

\label{sim1}
\end{figure}
%
We consider the system whose logical behavior is modeled by an untimed DES $G_{act}$ shown in \rfig{sim1}.
In the figure, each node represents the state of the system, and each edge represents the transition between them. 
The symbol $(e,l_e,u_e)$ near each edge represents the event  $e\in\Sigma_{act}$ associated with the edge, the lower time of $e$, and the upper time of $e$, respectively. The element in parentheses next to $s_i$ represents atomic propositions assigned to $s_i$ for $i\in[0,~5]$.
The initial state is $s_0$.
%
Based on the above definitions, the corresponding timed DES $G$ is constructed according to \rdef{def:G}. 
%
\subsubsection{Simulation result}
%
We consider the following hard constraint, and soft constraints and their weight.
\begin{align}
\phi=&\F{0,\Len}p_{fin},\notag \\
\Psi 
=&\{
(\psi_1=\G{0,\Len}(\lnot p_s),3),~
(\psi_2=\F{0,\Len}p_3,1),\notag \\
&~~(\psi_3=\F{0,\Len}p_4,1),~
(\psi=((\lnot p_4) \U{0,\Len} p_3,2)
\}.\notag
\end{align}
%
We use Gurobi to compute an optimal execution that optimizing the objective function $J_\kappa$. 
Let $\Len=20$. We compute optimal executions $\pi^1$, $\pi^2$, and $\pi^3$ with $\kappa=0.01,~0.5,1$, respectively, such that $\Pr(\pi^1)$, $\Pr(\pi^2)$, and $\Pr(\pi^3)$ are given by
\begin{align}
\Pr(\pi^1)=&
s_0,\ttick,s_0,\ttick,s_0,e_{03},s_3,\ttick,s_3,\ttick,\notag\\
&s_3,e_{34},s_4,\ttick,s_4,e_{40},s_0,e_{01},s_1,\notag\\
&\ttick,s_1,e_{12},s_2,\ttick,s_2,e_{25},s_5,\ldots,s_5\notag\\
\Pr(\pi^2)=&
s_0,\ttick,s_0,\ttick,s_0,e_{03},s_3,\ttick,\notag\\
&s_3,\ttick,s_3,e_{35},s_5,\ldots,s_5\notag \\
\Pr(\pi^3)=&s_0,e_{01},s_1,\ttick,s_1,e_{12},s_2,\ttick,s_2,e_{25},s_5,\ldots,s_5\notag
\end{align}
%
The time for $\pi^1$, $\pi^2$, and $\pi^3$ are 7, 4, and 2 [\tick], respectively.
The sum of weight of soft constraints satisfied by $\pi^1$, $\pi^2$, and $\pi^3$ are 4, 3, and 0.
The results of executions are shown that the combination of satisfied soft constraints is changed when the value of $\kappa$ is changed while satisfying the hard constraint.

\section{Hierarchical TDESs}\label{def:htdes}
%
\red{In this section, we introduce a novel hierarchical timed discrete event system (HTDES). In the case where the specification is very complicated, a hierarchical specification is a practically useful. For example, we consider a mobile robot in a manufacturing system with many assembling machines and a specification gives constraints for both its movement and scheduling of assembling a product. Then, we introduce an atomic proposition ``assembling a product'' in the specification for the movement because the robot moves to a machine that can assemble the product.  Then, we also describe the assembling operation by a pair of a TDES and a formula, where the TDES models a behavior of the machine and the formula describes a constraint for the assembling. See Section V-B for the detail. Such a planning problem is formulated using a hierarchical model where an atomic proposition at the upper-level TDES model is refined as a pair of a TDES and a formula at its lower-level model, where the granularity of the unit time at the lower-level TDES is finer than that of the upper-level TDES because the specification of the lower-level TDES is a refinement of an atomic proposition at the upper-level TDES. %For simplicity, we focus on a three-level HTDES which is composed of a top-level, a middle-level, and a bottom-level TDES with a specification. 
}
%
%
%階層プランニングはボトムアップのプランニングである。なので、まず下位TDESをProblem 1に従って、プランニングを行う。このとき、いくつかのαの値で実行列を求め、そのそれぞれについて、かかった時間とソフト制約の重みの合計を上位TDESに情報として与える。その情報をもとに上位TDESのプランニングを行う

In an $N_L$-level HTDES($N_L\geq 2$), we define level 1 and level $N_L$ as the top level and the bottom level, respectively.
There is a TDES $\overline{G}_{1}$ at the level 1.
$\overline{G}_{1}$ is given by $({G}_{{1},act},\tick_{1},\{T_{1,\sigma}|~\sigma\in\Sigma_{1}\})$ where $G_{{1},act}=(S_{{1},act},\Sigma_{{1},act},\delta_{{1},act},s_{init,{1},act},AP_{{1},act},L_{{1},act})$.
$S_{{1},act}$ is the set of states, $\Sigma_{{1},act}$ is the set of events, $\delta_{{1},act}$ is the transition function, $s_{init,{1},act}$ is the initial state, $AP_{{1},act}$ is the set of atomic propositions and $L_{{1},act}$ is its corresponding labeling function.
Additionally, $\tick_1$ is the unit time of the system modeled by $\overline{G}_1$, and $T_{1,\sigma}$ is a timer interval for each $\sigma\in\Sigma_{{1},act}$.

In our proposed HTDES, each TDES at the level 2 corresponds to an atomic proposition in $AP_{{1},act}$ and models detailed behavior.
We call these atomic propositions \textit{refined atomic propositions} and atomic propositions other than refined atomic propositions \textit{unrefined atomic propositions}.
%The index for the level 2 $1,i_{2}$ is denoted by $I_2$.
Then, we assume that the set of atomic propositions $\AP_{1,act}$ is partitioned into two sets $\AP_{1,act}^{R}$ and $\AP_{1,act}^{N}$.
The atomic propositions in $\AP_{1,act}^{R}$ and $\AP_{1,act}^{N}$ are refined and unrefined atomic proposition, respectively.
%
$\AP_{1,act}^R$ and $\AP_{1,act}^N$ are given by
\begin{eqnarray}
\AP_{1,act}^R&=&\{\textit{p}_{1,1},\textit{p}_{1,2},\ldots,p_{1,M_{1}}\}, \notag \\
\AP_{1,act}^N&=&\{\textit{p}_{I,M_{1}+1},\textit{p}_{1,M_{1}+2},\ldots,p_{1,|\AP_{1,act}|}\},\notag 
\end{eqnarray}
%
with the following assumption.
%
\begin{align}
\AP_{1,act}=\AP_{1,act}^R \cup \AP_{1,act}^N,~
\AP_{1,act}^R \cap \AP_{1,act}^N=\emptyset.\notag
\end{align}
%
Note that $G_{1}$ is refined by $M_{1}$ TDESs at the level 2.
Then, we denote the TDES at the level 2 corresponding $\textit{p}_{1,i_{2}}$ as $\overline{G}_{1,i_2}$ for $i_2\in[1,~M_{1}]$. 
For example, if $M_1=3$, there are three TDESs $\overline{G}_{1,1}$, $\overline{G}_{1,2}$, and $\overline{G}_{1,3}$.
%

In general, a TDES at the level $\ell$ is denoted by $\overline{G}_{i_1,\ldots,i_{\ell}}$ for $\ell\in[1,~N_L]$ and $i_\ell\in\mathbb{N}$.
Note that $i_1=1$, and we simply denote $i_1,\ldots,i_{\ell}$ by $I_{\ell}$.
A TDES $\overline{G}_{I_{\ell}}(=\overline{G}_{i_1,\ldots,i_{\ell}})$ is given by $({G}_{{I_{\ell}},act},\tick_{I_{\ell}},\{T_{{I_{\ell}},\sigma}|~\sigma\in\Sigma_{I_{\ell}}\})$ where $G_{{I_{\ell}},act}$ is a DES, $\tick_{I_{\ell}}$ is the unit time of the system modeled by $\overline{G}_{I_{\ell}}$, and $T_{{I_{\ell}},\sigma}$ is the timer interval for each event of $G_{{I_{\ell}},act}$ in the basis of $\tick_{I_{\ell}}$. %$G_{{I_{\ell}},act}=(S_{{I_{\ell}},act},\Sigma_{{I_{\ell}},act},\delta_{{I_{\ell}},act},s_{init,{I_{\ell}},act},AP_{{I_{\ell}},act},L_{{I_{\ell}},act})$.
%$S_{{I_{\ell}},act}$ is the set of states, $\Sigma_{{I_{\ell}},act}$ is the set of events, $\delta_{{I_{\ell}},act}$ is the transition function, $s_{init,{I_{\ell}},act}$ is the initial state, $AP_{{I_{\ell}},act}$ is the set of atomic propositions and $L_{{I_{\ell}},act}$ is its corresponding labeling function.
%We distinguish each unit time and introduce a corresponding special event that means the elapse of one unit time.
%$\tick_{I_{\ell}}$ is the unit time of the system modeled by $\overline{G}_{I_{\ell}}$, and the event $\textit{tick}_{I_{\ell}}$ means the elapse of \tick$_{I_{\ell}}$. 
Since the granularity of the unit time of each system modeled by a TDES may be different, $\tick_{I_\ell}$ is also different from other unit times. 
%The timer interval $T_{{I_{\ell}},\sigma}$ for each $\sigma\in\Sigma_{{I_{\ell}},act}$ is given in the basis of $\tick_{I_{\ell}}$.
A set of TDESs at the level $\ell$ is denoted by $\{\overline{G}_{\ell}\}$. 
According to \rdef{def:G}, the automaton $G_{I_{\ell}}$ corresponding to $\overline{G}_{I_{\ell}}$ is given by a tuple $G_{I_{\ell}}=(S_{I_{\ell}},\Sigma_{I_{\ell}},\delta_{I_{\ell}},s_{{I_{\ell}},init},AP_{I_{\ell}},L_{I_{\ell}})$.
%
%$S_{I_{\ell}}$ is the set of states, $\Sigma_{I_{\ell}}$ is the set of events, $\delta_{I_{\ell}}$ is the transition function, $s_{{I_{\ell}},init}$ is the initial state, $\AP_{I_{\ell}}$ is the set of atomic propositions and $L_{I_{\ell}}$ is its corresponding labeling function.
%
Executions of $G_{I_{\ell}}$ is given in the same way as \req{execution}.

In the following, we consider refined and unrefined atomic propositions of TDESs at the level $\ell_u(\in[1,N_L-1])$.
Each TDES at the level $\ell_u+1$ corresponds to one atomic proposition of a TDES at the level $\ell_u$. % and describes detailed behavior.
%We call these atomic propositions \textit{refined atomic propositions} and atomic propositions other than refined atomic propositions \textit{unrefined atomic propositions}.
For the level $\ell_u$, the index $1,i_2,\ldots,i_{\ell_u}$ is simply denoted by $\Iu$.
Then, the set of atomic propositions of $G_{{\Iu},act}$, denoted by $AP_{{\Iu},act}$, is partitioned into two sets of refined and unrefined atomic propositions, denoted by $\AP_{\Iu,act}^{R}$ and $\AP_{\Iu,act}^{N}$, respectively.
%Then, we assume that the set of atomic propositions $\AP_{\Iu,act}$ is partitioned into two sets $\AP_{\Iu,act}^{R}$ and $\AP_{\Iu,act}^{N}$.
%The atomic propositions in $\AP_{\Iu,act}^{R}$ and $\AP_{\Iu,act}^{N}$ are refined atomic proposition and unrefined atomic proposition, respectively.
%
$\AP_{\Iu,act}^R$ and $\AP_{\Iu,act}^N$ are given by
\begin{align}
\AP_{\Iu,act}^R=&\{\textit{p}_{\Iu,1},\textit{p}_{\Iu,2},\ldots,p_{\Iu,M_{\Iu}}\}, \notag \\
\AP_{\Iu,act}^N=&\{\textit{p}_{\Iu,M_{\Iu}+1},\textit{p}_{\Iu,M_{\Iu}+2},\ldots,p_{\Iu,|\AP_{\Iu,act}|}\},\notag 
\end{align}
%
with the following assumption.
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\AP_{\Iu,act}^R \cup \AP_{\Iu,act}^N&=&\AP_{\Iu,act},\notag \\
\AP_{\Iu,act}^R \cap \AP_{\Iu,act}^N&=&\emptyset.\notag
\end{eqnarray}
%
Note that $G_{\Iu}$ is refined by $M_{\Iu}$ TDESs at the level $\ell_u+1$.
Then, the TDES at the level $\ell_u+1$ corresponding to  $\textit{p}_{\Iu,i_{\ell_u+1}}$ is denoted by $\overline{G}_{\Iu,i_{\ell_u+1}}=\overline{G}_{i_1,\ldots,i_{\ell_u},i_{\ell_u+1}}$ for $i_{\ell_u+1}\in[1,~M_{\Iu}]$. 
%


%
%Denoted by \tick$_{I_{\ell}}$ is a unit time of $G_{{I_{\ell}},act}$ where ${I_{\ell}}$ denotes $i_1,\ldots,i_{\ell}$ for $\ell\in[1,~N_L]$. Then, the event $\textit{tick}_{I_{\ell}}$ means the elapse of \tick$_{I_{\ell}}$.
%
%
%
%Timer interval $T_{{I_{\ell}},\sigma}$ for each $\sigma\in\Sigma_{{I_{\ell}},act}$ is given in the basis of $\tick_{I_{\ell}}$.
%
%
%
We denote the $N_L$-level HTDES as follows. 
%
\begin{align}\label{htdes}
\mathcal{G}
=&\bigcup_{\ell\in[1,~N_L]}\{\overline{G}_\ell\}\notag \\
=&\{\overline{G}_1\}\cup\{\overline{G}_{1,i_{2}}|~i_2\in[1,~M_1]\}\cup\{\overline{G}_{1,i_{2},i_{3}}|~i_2\in[1,M_1],~i_3\in[1,~M_{1,i_2}]\}\notag \\
%&\cup\cdots\cup\{\overline{G}_{1,i_2,\ldots,i_{N_L}}|~i_2\in[1,M_1],\ldots,i_{N_L}\in[1,M_{1,\ldots,i_{N_L-1}}]\}\\
&~\cup\cdots\cup\{\overline{G}_{1,i_2,\ldots,i_{N_L}}|~i_\ell\in[1,~M_{I_{\ell-1}}],~ \ell\in[2,~N_L] \},
%=&\{\overline{G}_{i_1,\ldots,i_{\ell}}|~\ell\in[1,N_L],~i_\ell\in\mathbb{N}\},
\end{align}
where $I_\ell$ denotes the index  $1,i_2,\ldots,i_{\ell}$.
%
%
\begin{exa}\label{exa:hier}
Consider the following three-level HTDES consists of TDESs corresponding to DESs shown in \rfig{ex:htdes}.
\begin{align}
\mathcal{G}
=&\bigcup_{\ell\in[1,~3]}\{\overline{G}_\ell\}\notag \\
=&\{\overline{G}_1\}\cup\{\overline{G}_{1,1},\overline{G}_{1,2}\}\cup\{\overline{G}_{1,1,1},\overline{G}_{1,2,1}\},
\end{align}
where each TDES corresponds to a DES shown in \rfig{ex:htdes} and $M_1=2$, $M_{1,1}=M_{1,2}=1$.
For the DES at the level 1, denoted by  $G_{1,act}$, there are two states $s_{1}^1$ and $s_{2}^1$.
We define $\AP^R_{1,act}=\{p_{1,1},p_{1,2}\}$ and $\AP^N_{1,act}=\{p_{1,3}\}$. Then, atomic propositions are assigned to each state as follows.
\[
L_{1,act}(s_{1}^1) = \{p_{1,1},p_{1,3}\},~
L_{1,act}(s_{2}^1) = \{p_{1,1},p_{1,2}\}.
\]
$p_{1,1}$ and $p_{1,2}$ correspond to $\overline{G}_{1,1}$ and $\overline{G}_{1,2}$, respectively. 
Thus, detailed behaviors at $s_{1}^1$ and $s_{2}^1$ are described by $\overline{G}_{1,1}$, and $\overline{G}_{1,1}$ and $\overline{G}_{1,2}$, respectively.
%If $s_{1}^1$ or $s_{2}^1$ is stayed at in a plan of level 1, a plan of level 2 determined by $\overline{G}_{1,1}$ can be started.
%If $s_{2}^1$ is stayed at in a plan of level 1, both plans of level 2 determined by $\overline{G}_{1,1}$ and $\overline{G}_{1,2}$ can be started in parallel.
For the DESs at the level 2  $G_{1,1,act}$ and $G_{1,2,act}$, we define sets of atomic propositions and label functions as follows. 
\begin{gather}
\AP^R_{1,1,act}=\{p_{1,1,1}\},~\AP^N_{1,1,act}=\{p_{1,1,2}\},
\notag\\
\AP^R_{1,2,act}=\{p_{1,2,1}\},~\AP^N_{1,2,act}=\{p_{1,2,2}\},
\notag\\
L_{1,1,act}(s_{1}^{1,1}) = \{p_{1,1,1}\},~
L_{1,1,act}(s_{2}^{1,1}) = \{p_{1,1,2}\},
\notag\\
L_{1,2,act}(s_{1}^{1,2}) = \{p_{1,2,2}\},~
L_{1,2,act}(s_{2}^{1,2}) = \{p_{1,2,1}\},
\notag\\
L_{1,2,act}(s_{3}^{1,2}) = \{p_{1,2,1}\}.\notag
\end{gather}
%Then, there are two TDESs at the level 3 $\overline{G}_{1,1,1}$ and $\overline{G}_{1,2,1}$ which are composed of $G_{1,1,1,act}$ and $G_{1,2,1,act}$, respectively. 
%corresponding to $p_{1,1,1}$ and $p_{1,2,1}$.
%
$p_{1,1,1}$ and $p_{1,2,1}$ correspond to $\overline{G}_{1,1,1}$ and $\overline{G}_{1,2,1}$, respectively. 
Thus, detailed behaviors at $s_{1}^{1,1}$, and $s_{2}^{1,2}$ and $s_{3}^{1,2}$ are described by $\overline{G}_{1,1,1}$ and $\overline{G}_{1,2,1}$, respectively.

\section{Hierarchical planning}\label{sec:hplan}
%


%So, we first compute several candidates of a bottom-level plan with a finer time scale for each state of the middle-level TDES using the corresponding bottom-level TDES such that the plan is optimal for the corresponding objective function. Then, we find several candidates of a middle-level plan for the middle-level specification using the middle-level TDES such that a bottom-level plan at each refined state is determined(decided) of the candidates and all determined bottom-level plans are feasible under the middle-level plan. Finally, we find an optimal top-level plan and determine a middle plan at each refined state for the top-level specification using the top-level TDES such that all middle plans are feasible under the top-level plan.
We propose optimal hierarchical planning for an $N_L$-level HTDES introduced in the previous section.
Our proposed planning is based on a bottom-up approach such that every lower-level planer computes candidates of a plan for its upper-level planning, and the upper-level planer selects one of candidates to optimize its cost function when a refined atomic proposition holds.

As with \rsec{def:htdes}, we denote $1,i_2,\ldots,i_\ell$ as ${I_{\ell}}$ for $\ell\in[1,~N_L]$.
For each TDES $\overline{G}_{I_{\ell}}$, we consider a planning problem with a specification consisting of one hard constraint and some soft constraints, where all constraints are described by ticked LTL$_f$ formulas. 
The hard constraint is denoted by $\phi^{I_{\ell}}$ and soft constraints are denoted by $\psi_1^{I_{\ell}},...,\psi_{N^{I_{\ell}}_S}^{I_{\ell}}$ with the number of soft constraints $N^{I_{\ell}}_S$. 
We assume that there is a preference for each soft constraint, that is, if there is no execution that satisfies both $\psi_i$ and $\psi_j$, but there are executions that satisfy one of them, then, as a plan, we select an execution that satisfies the more preferable constraint.  
To represent the preference, we introduce a positive integer $w_n^{I_{\ell}}$, called a \textit{weight}, for each soft constraint $\psi_n^{I_{\ell}} (n \in [1,~N^{I_{\ell}}_S])$ and interpret that $\psi_n^{I_{\ell}}$ is more preferable than $\psi_m^{I_{\ell}}$ if $w_n^{I_{\ell}} >w_m^{I_{\ell}}$. 
Thus, an execution for which the sum of the weights of the satisfied soft constraints is larger is a more preferable one.
We denote a set of pairs of a soft constraint and its weight by $\Psi^{I_{\ell}}=\{(\psi_n^{I_{\ell}}, w_n^{I_{\ell}})|~n\in[1,~N^{I_{\ell}}_S]\}$ for $\overline{G}_{I_{\ell}}$.
In the following, we consider the planning at the $N_L$ level, and then planning at the $\ell_u$ level for $\ell_u\in[1,~N_L-1]$.
%

In the planning at the level $N_L$, we compute optimal  executions of $G_{I_b}$ that is the automaton for $\overline{G}_{I_b}$ as candidates of a plan where $I_b$ denotes the index $i_1,\ldots,i_{N_L}$.
Then, we introduce performance indexes of a objective function.
Note that different candidates optimize different objective functions which have the same performance indexes and (their) different coefficients.
%
Since we introduce the soft constraints to a planning problem, we have two performance indexes $J_{time}^{I_b}$ and $J_{soft}^{I_b}$ for a plan: $J_{time}^{I_b}$ indicates how fast the plan is completed and $J_{soft}^{I_b}$ indicates how large the sum of weights of the satisfied soft constraints is.
Then, a preferable plan minimizes $J_{time}^{I_b}$ and maximizes $J_{soft}^{I_b}$ simultaneously, which causes a trade-off between the indexes. 
To represent the trade-off, we introduce the following objective function $J_{\kappa}^{I_b}$ with $0 \leq \kappa \leq 1$.
\begin{equation}
J_{\kappa}^{I_b}=-\kappa J_{time}^{I_b} + (1-\kappa) J_{soft}^{I_b}.
\end{equation}
The coefficient(parameter) $\kappa$ represents which index is more important.
%
To compute candidates of a plan, we find executions of $G_{I_b}$ that optimize $J_{\kappa}^{I_b}$ with some values of $\kappa$ since the results of execution are different when we change the value of $\kappa$.
%
A set of $\kappa$ is denoted as $K$ and given by
$K=\{\kappa_1,\ldots,\kappa_{|K|}\}$ with $0\leq\kappa_i\leq 1$ for $i\in [1,~|K|]$.
%
The result of execution of $G_{I_b}$ with the given length $\Len_{I_b}$ is denoted by $\pi_{I_b}(J_\kappa^{I_b})$ or simply  $\pi_{I_b}(J_\kappa)$ which satisfies $\phi^{I_b}$ and optimizes the objective function $J_\kappa^{I_b}$.
%

Let $\Iu$ be the index $1,i_2,\ldots,i_{\ell_u}$ for $\ell_u\in[1,~N_L-1]$.
In the planning at the level $\ell_u$, we compute executions of $G_{\Iu}$ as candidates of a plan of each $\overline{G}_{\Iu}$ with selecting a plan of candidates for each its lower-level TDES.
We consider an objective function for the level $\ell_u$ with coefficients whose set is denoted by  $\Lambda^{\ell_u}$.
For performance indexes, we introduce $J_{time}^{\Iu}$ and $J_{soft}^{\Iu}$ as with $J_{time}^{I_b}$ and $J_{soft}^{I_b}$, respectively.
Additionally, for the selecting, we introduce a performance index $J_{lower}^{\Iu}$ which indicates how large the sum of weights of soft constraints satisfied by selected(completed) its lower-level plans is.
%
The value of $J_{lower}^{\Iu}$ is determined by the time for each its lower-level plan and the sum of weights of soft constraints satisfied by the plan.
Let ${\Iu^+}$ be the index $1,i_2,\ldots,i_{\ell_u},i_{\ell_u+1}$ for $i_{\ell_u+1}\in M_{\Iu}$.
Then, a TDES $\overline{G}_{\Iu^+}$ corresponds to the atomic proposition $p_{\Iu^+}$ of $\overline{G}_{\Iu}$, and ${\tick}_{\Iu^+}$ is the unit time of $\overline{G}_{\Iu^+}$.
Since time granularity of the unit time of each system may be different, the time for a plan determined by an execution $\pi_{\Iu^+}$ with respect to $\tick_{\Iu}$ is as follows.
\begin{align}\label{ti}
m_{\pi_{\Iu^+}}=\left\lfloor \left(\textit{count}_{\pi_{\Iu^+}}(0,\Len_{{\Iu^+}})
\right)\cdot\frac{{\tick}_{\Iu^+}}{{\tick}_{\Iu}} \right\rfloor,
\end{align}
where $\Len_{{\Iu^+}}$ is a given length for $\pi_{{\Iu^+}}$, $(\textit{count}_{\pi_{{\Iu^+}}}(0,\Len_{{\Iu^+}}) )$ represents the time for $\pi_{{\Iu^+}}$ with respect to ${\tick}_{{\Iu^+}}$, and $\lfloor x \rfloor =\max\{n\in\mathbb{Z}|\ n\leq x\}$.
Additionally, the sum of weights of soft constraints satisfied by $\pi_{{\Iu^+}}$ is denoted by $W_{{\Iu^+}}$.
Then, we define $\mathcal{M}_{\Iu}$ and $\mathcal{W}_{\Iu}$ as follows.
\begin{align}
\mathcal{M}_{\Iu}&=\{m_{\pi_{\Iu^+}(J_p)}|~\Iu^+=i_1,\ldots,i_{\ell_u},i_{\ell_u+1},~i_{\ell_u+1}\in[1,~M_{\Iu}],p\in P\},\\
\mathcal{W}_{\Iu}&=\{W_{\pi_{i_1,\ldots,i_{\ell_u},i_{\ell_u+1}}(J_p)}|~i_{\ell_u+1}\in[1,~M_{\Iu}],~p\in P\},
\end{align}
where $P$ represents a set of coefficients of the objective function for $\overline{G}_{\Iu^+}$.
If ${\ell_u+1}=N_L$, $p\in P\coloneqq K$, and otherwise $p\in P\coloneqq\Lambda^{\ell_u+1}$.
The value of $J_{lower}^{\Iu}$ is determined by the elements in $\mathcal{M}_{\Iu}$ and $\mathcal{W}_{\Iu}$.
%where $P=K$ if $\Iu$ denotes $i_1,\ldots,i_{\ell_u},i_{N_L-1}$, i.e., $\ell_u=N_L-1$ and otherwise $P=\Lambda^{\ell_u}$.
%
Then, to represent a trade-off among $J_{time}^{\Iu}$, $J_{soft}^{\Iu}$, and $J_{lower}^{\Iu}$, we introduce the objective function as follows.
\begin{align}
J_{\lambda^{\ell_u}}^{\Iu}(\pi_{\Iu},\mathcal{M}_{\Iu},\mathcal{W}_{\Iu})
=&-\lambda_1^{\ell_u} J_{time}^{\Iu}(\pi_{\Iu}) + \lambda_2^{\ell_u} J_{lower}^{\Iu}(\mathcal{M}_{\Iu},\mathcal{W}_{\Iu})
\notag\\&+ (1-\lambda_1^{\ell_u}-\lambda_2^{\ell_u})J_{soft}^{\Iu}(\pi_{\Iu}),
\end{align}
where $0\leq\lambda_1^{\ell_u},{\lambda}_2^{\ell_u}\leq1$, $\lambda_1^{\ell_u}+{\lambda}_2^{\ell_u}\leq1$, and ${\lambda}^{\ell_u}$ denotes the pair of $\lambda_1^{\ell_u}$ and $\lambda_2^{\ell_u}$.
The coefficients $\lambda_1^{\ell_u}$ and ${\lambda}_2^{\ell_u}$ represent which indexes are more important for $\overline{G}_{\Iu}$.
%
We denote a set of some ${\lambda}^{\ell_u}$ by $\Lambda^{\ell_u}$.
Then, we compute candidates of a plan represented by $\pi_{\Iu}(J_{\lambda^{\ell_u}}^{\Iu})$ for all $\lambda^{\ell_u}\in\Lambda^{\ell_u}$ ($|\Lambda^{\ell_u}|\geq1$).
Note that we compute one plan at the level 1, i.e., $|\Lambda^1|=1$, since there is no upper-level than level 1.

\begin{comment}
%
Then, we define $\mathcal{M}_i$ and $\mathcal{W}_i$ as follows.
\begin{align}
\mathcal{M}_i&=\{m_{\pi_{{I^+}}(J_\kappa)}|~j_i\in[1,~M_i],~\kappa\in K\},\\
\mathcal{W}_i&=\{W_{\pi_{{I^+}}(J_\kappa)}|~j_i\in[1,~M_i],~\kappa\in K\}.
\end{align}
%



We introduce $\pi(J)$ as an execution of a TDES $G'$ which optimizes an objective function $J$.
Let ${\tick}_{l}$ and ${\tick}_u$ be a unit time of the TDES $G'$ and one of its upper-level TDES, respectively.
$m_{\pi(J)}$ is defined as the time for $\pi(J)$ with respect to ${\tick}_{u}$ and given by
\begin{align}\label{ti}
m_{\pi(J)}=\left\lceil \left(\textit{count}_{\pi(J)}(0,\Len)+1\right)\cdot\frac{{\tick}_l}{{\tick}_{u}} \right\rceil,
\end{align}
where $\Len$ is a given length for $\pi(J)$, $(\textit{count}_{\pi(J)}(0,\Len)+1 )$ represents the time for $\pi(J)$ with respect to ${\tick}_l$, and $\lceil x \rceil =\min\{n\in\mathbb{Z}|\ x\leq n\}$.
Let $W_{\pi(J)}$ be the reward which is given for implementation of $\pi(J)$ at its upper-level plan. 
For example, $W_{\pi(J)}$ is the sum of weights of soft constraints satisfied by $\pi(J)$ or the optimal value of $J$. 
$m_{\pi(J)}$ and $W_{\pi(J)}$ are used when a planer selects one of candidates of its lower-level plan.
Then, we consider what kinds of performance indexes are needed for each level planning.


In the middle-level planning, we have three performance indexes $J_{time}^i$, $J_{soft}^i$, and $J_{lower}^i$.
$J_{time}^i$ and $J_{soft}^i$ have the same meanings as $J_{time}^{i,j_i}$ and $J_{soft}^{i,j_i}$, respectively.
$J_{lower}^i$ indicates how large the sum of rewards of completed bottom-level plans is.
The value of $J_{lower}$ is determined by $\M_i$ and $\W_i$.
To represent a trade-off among $J_{time}^i$, $J_{soft}^i$, and $J_{lower}^i$, we introduce the objective function as follows.
\[
J_{\lambda,\M_i,\W_i}=-\lambda_1 J_{time}^i + \lambda_2J_{lower}^i+ (1-\lambda_1-\lambda_2)J_{soft}^i,
\]
where $0\leq\lambda_1,{\lambda}_2\leq1$, $\lambda_1+{\lambda}_2\leq1$, and $\lambda$ denotes the pair of $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$.
The parameter $\lambda_1$ and ${\lambda}_2$ represent which indexes are more important.
%
%The parameter $\lambda_1$ represents the importance of $J_{time}$, and $\lambda_2$ represents the importance of $J_{lower}^i$. Moreover, $1-\lambda_1-\lambda_2$ represents the importance of $J_{soft}^i$.
We denote a set of some $\lambda$ by $\Lambda$, respectively.
Then, we compute candidates of a plan represented by $\pi_{i}(J_{\lambda,\M_i,\W_i})$ for $\lambda\in\Lambda$ ($|\Lambda|>1$) and each $i\in[1,~M]$.
%Then, we define an objective function $J_{\lambda}$ with parameters in $\lambda\in\Lambda$ for middle-level TDESs, and 
Then, we define $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{W}$ as follows.
\begin{align}
\mathcal{M}&=\{m_{\pi_{i}(J_{\lambda,\M_i,\W_i})}|~i\in[1,~M],~\lambda\in \Lambda\},\\
\mathcal{W}&=\{W_{\pi_{i}(J_{\lambda,\M_i,\W_i})}|~i\in[1,~M],~\lambda\in \Lambda\}.
\end{align}
%

In the top-level planning, we have three performance indexes $J_{time}$, $J_{soft}$, and $J_{lower}$ in the same way as the middle-level planning.
Then, we find a trajectory of $G$ with a length $\Len$ and the specification given to $G$ while optimizing the following objective function.
%We assume that the top-level planning does not need to consider the time for the result of an execution.Then, there are two performance indexes $J_{soft}$ and $J_{lower}$ in the top-level planning.
%We denote a ratio of the importance of $J_{lower}$ to $J_{soft}$ by $\mu$ with $0\leq\mu\leq1$, and the objective function for the top-level planning is as follows.
\[
J_{\mu,\M,\W} = \mu_1 J_{time}+ \mu_2 J_{lower} + (1-\mu_1-\mu_2)J_{soft},
\]
where $0\leq\mu_1,{\mu}_2\leq1$, $\mu_1+{\mu}_2\leq1$, and $\mu$ denotes the pair of $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$.
These $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ represent trade-off among $J_{time}$, $J_{lower}$, and $J_{soft}$.

In summary, we consider the following problem to find a plan of a $N_L$-level HTDES with $I_\ell$, $I_b$, and $\Iu$.% denotes $i_1,\ldots,i_{\ell}$.
\begin{pbm}\label{pbm3}
For all $\ell\in[1,~N_L]$ and $\ell_u\in[1,~N_L-1]$, given a $N_L$-level HTDES $\mathcal{G}$, a hard constraint $\phi^{I_{\ell}}$, and a set of pairs of a soft constraint and its weight $\Psi^{I_{\ell}}$, the length $\Len_{I_{\ell}}$, 
coefficients for objective functions $K$, $\Lambda^{\Iu}$, and objective functions $J_\kappa^{I_b}$, $J_{\lambda}^{\Iu}$, find an overall plan of $\mathcal{G}$ by the following procedure.

In the following, we introduce objective functions concretely and convert Problem 1 into an ILP problem by using the encodings considered in \rsec{encode}.
\subsection{Objective function}
%
%We introduce the objective functions we consider in this simulation concretely.
%We simply denote $J_{\lambda,\M_i,\W_i}$ and $J_{\mu,\M,\W}$ as $J_{\lambda}$ and $J_{\mu}$, respectively.
We first introduce the performance indexes of the objective function $J_\kappa^{I_b}$ for the planning at the level $N_L$. 
Based on the binary variables used in encoding of a trajectory of each $G_{I_b}$ and the ticked LTL${}_f$ formula $\psi^{I_b}_n$, $J_{time}^{I_b}$ and $J_{soft}^{I_b}$ in $J_{\kappa}^{I_b}$ are given by
\begin{align}\label{obj:1}
J_{time}^{I_b}=\sum_{k=1}^{\Len_{I_b}}z_{G_{I_b},e}(k),~ J_{soft}^{I_b}=\sum_{n=1}^{N_{I_b}} w_{n}^{I_b}\cdot z_{\psi_{n}^{I_b}}(0), 
\end{align}
where $z_{G_{I_b},e}(k)=1$ means that the $k$-th event of the execution is $\ttick_{I_b}$ and $z_{\psi_{n}^{I_b}}(0)=1$ means that the plan satisfies the soft constraint $\psi_{n}^{I_b}$.
Note that $J_{time}^{I_b}$ indicates the number of the event $\ttick_{I_b}$ in the execution corresponding to the plan and $J_{soft}^{I_b}$ is the sum of the preferences of the soft constraints satisfied by the plan. 
%

Next, we consider the performance indexes of the objective function $J_{\lambda^{\ell_u}}^{\Iu}$ for the planning at the level $\ell_u(\in[1,~N_L-1])$.
We simply denote $\lambda^{\ell_u}$ and ${\Iu}$ as $\lambda$ and $I$, respectively.
Based on the binary variables used in encoding of a trajectory of each $G_{I}$ and the ticked LTL${}_f$ formula $\psi^{I}_n$, $J_{time}^I$ and $J_{soft}^I$ in $J_{\lambda}^I$ are given in the same way as $J_{time}^{I_b}$ and $J_{soft}^{I_b}$ in $J_{\kappa}^{I_b}$ as follows. 
\begin{align}\label{obj:2}
J_{time}^{I}=\sum_{k=1}^{\Len_{I}}z_{G_{I},e}(k),~ J_{soft}^{I}=\sum_{n=1}^{N_S^{I}} w_{n}^{I}\cdot z_{\psi_{n}^{I}}(0).
\end{align}
%
\begin{comment}
Then, we consider $J_{lower}^i$ that indicates the sum of rewards of completed bottom-level plans.
One of candidates $\pi_{i,j_i}(J_\kappa)$ for $\kappa\in K$ can be selected when $z_{p_{i,{j_i}}}(k)=1$ for $j_i\in[1,~M_i]$. 
To represent which plan is selected at the $k$-th state of the trajectory of $G_i$, we introduce $\Len_i + 1$ binary variables $y_{p_{i,{j_i}},\kappa}(k)\in\{0,~1\}$ for $k\in[0,~\Len_i]$, $i\in[1,~M]$, $j_i\in[1,~M_i]$, and $\kappa\in K$.
Only if $p_{i,{j_i}}$ is true at the $k$-th state, i.e., $z_{p_{i,{j_i}}}(k)=1$, $y_{p_{i,{j_i}},\kappa}(k)=1$ that  represents that the bottom-level plan of $G_{i,{j_i}}$ determined by $\pi_{i,j_i}(J_\kappa)$ is selected at the $k$-th state.
To represent when and which bottom-level plan is \red{put into action}, we introduce $\Len_i + 1$ binary variables ${y}^{i,j_i}_{\kappa}$ as follows.
\begin{align}
y^{i,j_i}_{\kappa}
=\G{0,m_{\pi_{i,j_i}(J_\kappa)}} y_{p_{i,j_i},\kappa}.\label{hier2-1}
\end{align}
For each $k\in[0,~\Len_i]$, ${y}^{i,j_i}_{\kappa}(k)=1$ represents that the bottom-level plan determined by $\pi_{i,j_i}(J_\kappa)$ is \red{put into action} from the $k$-th state of $\pi_i(J_\lambda)$ until $m_{\pi_{i,j_i}(J_\kappa)}$ is passed.
Since each bottom-level TDES represents detailed behavior of a task(system?), e.x., a detailed procedure of an operation, one of candidates have to be completed for every stay at the states where refined atomic propositions are assigned.
Then, $y_{p_{i,{j_i}},\kappa}(k)$ satisfy the following equations.
\begin{align}\label{hier1}
%{y}_{p_{i,{j_i}},\kappa}(k) \leq z_{p_{i,{j_i}}}(k).
\sum_{\kappa\in K}{y}_{p_{i,{j_i}},\kappa}(k) = z_{p_{i,{j_i}}}(k),~\mbox{for }\forall k\in[0,~\Len_i].
\end{align}
%

\end{comment}
Then, we consider $J_{lower}^{I}$ that indicates the sum of weights of soft constraints satisfied by selected its lower-level plans.
To represent which plan is selected and when the selected plan starts, we introduce $\Len_I + 1$ binary variables ${y}^{{{I^+}}}_{p}$ where ${I^+}$ simply denotes $i_1,\ldots,i_{\ell_u},i_{\ell_u+1}$, and 
$p\in P\coloneqq K$ if ${\ell_u+1}=N_L$ and otherwise $p\in P\coloneqq\Lambda^{\ell_u+1}$.
%$p$ represents one of coefficients or pairs of coefficients for the level ${\ell_u+1}$.
%If ${\ell_u+1}=N_L$, $p\in P\coloneqq K$, and otherwise $p\in P\coloneqq\Lambda^{\ell_u+1}$.
For each $k\in[0,~\Len_I]$, ${y}^{{I^+}}_{p}(k)=1$ represents that its lower-level plan determined by $\pi_{{I^+}}(J_p)$ starts at the $k$-th state of $\pi_I(J_\lambda)$ and completes after $m_{\pi_{{I^+}}(J_p)}$ unit times are elapsed.
$y^{{I^+}}_{\kappa}$ satisfy the following equation.
\begin{align}
y^{{I^+}}_{p}
=\G{0,m_{\pi_{{I^+}}(J_p)}} x_{p}^{I^+},\label{hier2-1}
\end{align}
where $x_{p}^{I^+}(k)$ for $k\in [0,~\Len_I + 1]$ are $\Len_I + 1$ binary variables and defined by 
\begin{align}\label{hier:y}
x_{p}^{I^+}(k)=
\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
1 & \mbox{$\pi_{{I^+}}(J_p)$ is executing at }s(k), \\
0 & \mbox{otherwise.}
\end{array} \right. ,
\end{align}
and satisfy the following equation.
\begin{align}\label{hier1}
\sum_{p\in P}x_{p}^{{I^+}}(k) = z_{p_{{I^+}}}(k),~\mbox{for }\forall k\in[0,~\Len_I].
\end{align}
From \req{hier:y}, $x_{p}^{I^+}(k)=1$ that represents that its lower-level plan of $\overline{G}_{{I^+}}$ determined by $\pi_{{I^+}}(J_p)$ is executing at the $k$-th state.
\req{hier1} represents one of candidates $\pi_{{I^+}}(J_p)$ for $p\in P$ can be selected when $p_{{I^+}}$ holds at the $k$-th state, i.e., $z_{p_{{I^+}}}(k)=1$ .
%
Additionally, we introduce $\Len_i + 1$ binary variables $y^{{I^+}}_{{cons}}$.
$y^{{I^+}}_{{cons}}$ represents the constraint such that only one of candidates of a its lower-level plan of $\overline{G}_{I^+}$ is done from the state where $p_{{I^+}}$ changes from false to true. 
Then, $y^{{I^+}}_{{cons}}$ satisfy the following equations.
%
\begin{eqnarray}
y^{{I^+}}_{{cons}}(0)~~ &=& z_{p_{{I^+}}}(0) \Leftrightarrow\bigvee_{p\in K} {y}^{{I^+}}_{p}(0),\label{hier2-2-0}\\
y^{I^+}_{{cons}}(k+1) &=& (\lnot z_{p_{I^+}}(k))\land (z_{p_{I^+}}(k+1)) 
\notag\\&&~\Leftrightarrow\bigvee_{p\in K} {y}^{I^+}_{p}(k+1),\label{hier2-2}
\end{eqnarray}
where $k\in[0,~\Len_{I^+}-1]$.
%
\begin{exa}
We consider the following execution of the TDES corresponding to $G_{1,2,act}$ of Example \ref{exa:hier}.
\begin{align}
\Pr(\pi_{1,2,\lambda})
=&s^{1,2}_1,\sigma_{1,2},s^{1,2}_2,\ttick_{1,2},s^{1,2}_2,\sigma_{21},\notag \\
&s^{1,2}_1,\sigma_{1,3},s^{1,2}_3,\ttick_{1,2},s^{1,2}_3,\ttick_{1,2},s^{1,2}_3,\notag
\end{align}
where $\sigma_{i,j}\in\Sigma_{1,2,act}$ for $i,j\in[1,3],i\neq j$, $s^{1,2}_j=\delta_{2,act}(s_i^{1,2},\sigma_{i,j})$, and timer intervals for all events are given by $[0,~\infty]$.
There are $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$, and we have $m_{\pi_{1,2,1}(J_{\kappa_1})}=1$ and $m_{\pi_{1,2,1}(J_{\kappa_2})}=2$.
In $\pi_{1,2,\lambda}$, the plan determined by $\kappa_1$ ({\sl resp.} $\kappa_2$) is done when $s^{1,2}_2$  ({\sl resp.} $s^{1,2}_3$) is stayed at.
When $s^{1,2}_3$ is stayed at, the plan determined by $\kappa_1$ can not be done twice because of $(\lnot z_{p_{1,2,1}}(k))\land (z_{p_{1,2,1}}(k+1))$ in \req{hier2-2}.
\qedwhite
\end{exa}
%
%In this simulation, let the reward for $\pi(J)$, denoted by $W_{\pi(J)}$, be the sum of weights of soft constraints that $\pi(J)$ satisfies.
%
Then, we introduce $J_{lower}^I$ in the objective function $J_{\lambda}^I$ for $\overline{G}_I$ with ${y}^{{I^+}}_p$ as follows.
\begin{align}\label{obj:3}
J_{lower}^I=\sum_{i_{\ell_u +1}=1}^{M_I} \sum_{p\in P} \sum_{k=0}^{\Len_I} {y}^{I^+}_p(k) \cdot {W_{\pi_{I^+}(J_p)}}.
\end{align}
%
%We determine $J_\lambda^I$ with \req{obj:2} and \req{obj:3}, and add the constraints \req{hier1}-\req{hier2-2} to the constraint of {\bf ILP\ref{pbm3}-2}.




\subsection{Optimization problem}
We convert \rpbm{pbm3} into the following ILP problems by using the encodings considered in Section \ref{encode}. 
First, for the bottom-level planning, the ILP problem {\bf ILP\ref{pbm3}-1} to find $w_{G_{I_b}}(k)\in\{0,1\}^{|S_{I_b}|}$ ($k=[0,~\Len_{I_b}]$) is given by
%=\sum_{k=1}^{\Len_{I}}z_e(k),~ J_{soft}^{I}=\sum_{n=1}^{N_S^{I}} w_{n}^{I}\cdot z_{\psi_{n}^{I}}(0).
\begin{eqnarray}
&\mbox{\bf ILP\ref{pbm3}-1}: &\notag\\
&\mbox{maximize}&\kappa \sum_{k=1}^{\Len_{I_b}}z_{G_{I_b},e}(k)\notag\\&&+ (1-\kappa)\sum_{n=1}^{N_S^{I_b}} w_{n}^{I_b}\cdot z_{\psi_{n}^{I_b}}(0) \notag \\
&\mbox{subject to}&SYS(G_{I_b}), \notag \\
&& LTL(\phi^{I_b}),\notag \\
&& LTL(\psi^{I_b}_n) \  {\rm{for\ each\ }}  n \in [1,\ N_{I_b}], \notag\\
&& w_{G_{I_b}}(0)=w_{G_{I_b},s_0}, \notag \\
&&z_{\phi^{I_b}} (0) = 1. \notag
\end{eqnarray}
Next, for the planning at the level $\ell_u(\in[1,~N_L-1])$, the ILP problem {\bf ILP\ref{pbm3}-2} to find $w_{G_{\Iu}}(k)\in\{0,1\}^{|S_{\Iu}|}$ ($k=[0,~\Len_{\Iu}]$) for each $G_{\Iu}$ in order from $\ell_u=N_L-1$ to $\ell_u=1$ is given by
\begin{eqnarray}
&\mbox{\bf ILP\ref{pbm3}-2}: &\notag\\
&\mbox{maximize}& 
-\lambda_1^{\ell_u} \sum_{k=1}^{\Len_{\Iu}}z_{G_{I_{\ell_u}},e}(k)
\notag\\&& + \lambda_2^{\ell_u} \sum_{i_{\ell_u+1}=1}^{M_{\Iu}} \sum_{p\in P} \sum_{k=0}^{\Len_{\Iu}} {y}^{\Iu^+}_\kappa(k) \cdot {W_{\pi_{\Iu^+}(J_\kappa)}}
\notag\\&&+ (1-\lambda_1^{\ell_u}-\lambda_2^{\ell_u})\sum_{n=1}^{N_S^{\Iu}}w_{n}^{\Iu}\cdot z_{\psi_{n}^{\Iu}}(0)
\notag \\
&\mbox{subject to}&SYS(G_{\Iu}), \notag \\
&& LTL(\phi^{\Iu}),\notag \\
&& LTL(\psi^{\Iu}_n) \  {\rm{for\ each\ }}  n \in [1,\ N_S^{\Iu}], \notag\\
&& w_{G_{\Iu}}(0)=w_{G_{\Iu},s_0}, \notag \\
&&z_{\phi^{\Iu}} (0) = 1, \notag\\
&&\req{hier1}-\req{hier2-2}.\notag
\end{eqnarray}
%
Note that, if there are no feasible solutions of the ILP problem {\bf ILP\ref{pbm3}-1} and {\bf ILP\ref{pbm3}-2}, there are no plan satisfying the hard constraint.  In such a case, we denote $\pi_{I_\ell}=\bot$ for $\ell\in[1,~N_L]$.
Additionally, if $\pi_{I_{\ell'}}=\bot$ for $\ell'\in[2,~N_L]$, we update a set of atomic propositions $\AP$ and a label function $L$ of its upper-level TDES $\overline{G}$ such that $\AP\leftarrow \AP\setminus \{p_{I_{\ell'}}\}$ and $L(s)\leftarrow L(s)\setminus \{p_{I_{\ell'}}\}$ for all states of $\overline{G}$.
\begin{comment}


Finally, for the top-level planning, the ILP problem {\bf ILP\ref{pbm3}-3} for finding $w_G(k)\in\{0,1\}^{|S|}$ ($k=[0,~\Len]$) is given by
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\mbox{\bf ILP\ref{pbm3}-3}: 
&\mbox{maximize }&J_{\mu,\M,\W} \notag \\
&\mbox{subject to }&SYS(G), \notag \\
&& LTL(\phi),\notag \\
&& LTL(\psi_n) \  {\rm{for\ each\ }}  n \in [1,\ N], \notag\\
&& w_G(0)=w_{G,s_0}, \notag \\
&&z_{\phi} (0) = 1. \notag
\end{eqnarray}
%

\end{comment}



%We obtain candidates of a plan of every TDES for all $\kappa\in K$ and all $\lambda\in \Lambda$ by solving {\bf ILP\ref{pbm3}-1} and {\bf ILP\ref{pbm3}-2}.

%

We consider a path planning problem where a robot moves the areas while doing tasks which is assigned to the corresponding states.
In the top-level planning, we consider an order to visit states that represent locations.
In the middle-level planning, we determine plans to operate procedures of tasks. 
Then, in bottom-level planning, we determine plans of procedures in detail.
%
%
First, for the top-level planning, we introduce a DES $G_{act}$ for modeling behaviors of the robot 
 with the coarse granularity of the unit time as shown in \rfig{pTDES}.
%
The $G_{act}$ is represented by a $6\times6$ grid where $S_{act}=\{s_{act,0},s_{act,1},\ldots,s_{act,{34}},s_{act,{35}}\}$, and there is a transition between $s_{act,i}$ and $s_{act,j}$ if and only if $s_{act,i}$ and $s_{act,j}$ are adjacent locations horizontally or vertically with the events $\textit{up}_i$, $\textit{down}_i$, $\textit{left}_i$, or $\textit{right}_i$.
%In the figure, each grid represents a state and, for every state $s_i$, there are transitions between $s_i$ and the states connected to $s_i$ horizontally or vertically .
%
The initial state $s_{init,act}$ is the left-top state $s_0$.
$\AP_{act}=\{p_i|~i\in[0,5]\}$ is the set of atomic propositions and the labeling function $L_{act}$ is given by
\begin{align}
&L_{act}(s_{act, 10 }) =  p_1,\
L_{act}(s_{act,19}) =  p_1, \notag \\
&L_{act}(s') = p_2,\mbox{ for } s'\in\{s_{act,3},s_{act,4},s_{act,5},s_{act,10},s_{act,11},s_{act,17}\}, \notag\\
&L_{act}(s_{act, 31 }) = p_3,\ 
L_{act}(s_{act, 34 }) =  p_3, \notag\\
&L_{act}(s'') =  p_4\mbox{ for } s'\in\{s_{act,2},s_{act,8},s_{act,14},s_{act,20},s_{act,26},s_{act,32}\},\notag\\
&L_{act}(s) =  p_5\mbox{ for other states.}
\end{align}
We define $\AP_{act}^R=\{p_1,p_2,p_3\}$ and $\AP_{act}^N=\{p_4,p_5\}$ 
The time scale of $G_{act}$ is given by ${\tick}_p=100$, and, for every $\sigma\in \Sigma$, the timer interval is given by $T_\sigma=[1,\infty]$ in the basis of ${\tick}_p$.
%
%
Then, we introduce DESs for modeling procedures of tasks (behaviors of systems) used in middle-level planning as shown in \rfig{cTDES}.
We introduce three DESs, for $i=1,2,3$, $G_{i,act}=(S_{i,act}, \Sigma_{i,act}, \delta_{i,act},s_{init,i,act}, L_{i,act}, A_{i,act})$ corresponding to $p_i\in \textit{AP}$, respectively.
For $i=1,2,3$ and $j\in[0,\ |S_{i,act}|]$, the element in parentheses next to $s_j^i$ represents atomic propositions assigned to $s_j^i$.
%
The symbol $(e,l_e,u_e)$ near each edge represents the event  $e$ associated with the edge, the lower time of $e$, and the upper time of $e$.
We set $\AP_{1,act}^R=\{p_{1,1}\}$, $\AP_{2,act}^R=\{p_{1,2,1}\}$, and $\AP_{3,act}^R=\{p_{1,3,1},p_{1,3,2}\}$
%

%
$G_{1,act}$ represents a procedure to \textit{load a luggage}. At the states $s_{1,1}$ and $s_{1,2}$ where the atomic proposition $p_{1,1}$ is assigned, luggage is   loaded in the robot.
$G_{2,act}$ represents a Solar power generation system. 
The atomic proposition $p_{1,2,1}$ assigned to $s_1^2$ represents the state of checking battery.
$G_{3,act}$ represents two procedures using the same machine, and these two procedures can not be operated at the same time.
The atomic proposition $p_{1,3,1}$ assigned to $s_1^3$ and $s_3^3$ represents the state of using the machine.
At the states $s_2^3$ and $s_4^3$ where the atomic proposition $p_{1,3,2}$ is assigned, the machine is cleaned up.

%
%
%
%
The unit time $\tick_i$ of $G_{i,act}$ for each $i=1,2,3$ are given by
\begin{align}
&{\tick}_1=80,~{\tick}_2=90,~{\tick}_3=80,\notag\\
{\tick}_{1,1}=&70,~{\tick}_{2,1}=60,~{\tick}_{1,3,1}=70,~{\tick}_{1,3,2}=50,\notag
\end{align}
respectively.

    %\vspace{0.1cm}
\end{figure}
%
Finally, we introduce DESs for modeling procedures(behaviors) of systems used in the bottom-level planning as shown in \rfig{l:TDES}.
%
From the above settings for DESs, we have the three-level HTDES with eight TDESs. 
%
\subsection{Specifications for hierarchical planning}
%
To determine a hierarchical plan for the robot, we give a specification for each TDES.
For the TDES a the level 1 $\overline{G}_1$, a hard constraint $\phi^1$ and a set of pairs of a soft constraint and its weight $\Psi^1$ are given by
\begin{align}
\phi^1=&\G{0,\Len}(p_{1,1}\to\F{0,10}p_{1,3}), \notag \\
\Psi^1=&\{
(\psi^1_1=\G{1,5}\lnot p_{1,4}, 2), ~
(\psi^1_2=\F{0,\Len}\G{0,2}p_{1,2}, 1),\notag\\&~
(\psi^1_3=\F{0,\Len}\G{0,4}p_{1,2}, 2),~
(\psi^1_4=\F{0,\Len}\G{0,4}p_{1,3}, 3),\notag\\&~
(\psi^1_5=\F{0,\Len}(p_{1,1}\land p_{1,2}),1)
\}.\notag
\end{align}
%
A hard constraint $\phi^{1,i_2}$ and a set of pairs of a soft constraint and its weight $\Psi^{1,i_2}$ for each $G_{1,i_2}$ are as follows, respectively.
\begin{align}
\phi^{1,1}=&\F{0,\Len_{1,1}}p_{1,1,5},\notag \\
\Psi^{1,1} 
=&\{
(\psi^{1,1}_{1} =\F{0,\Len_{1,1}}p_{1,1,4}, 1),~

\} ,\notag
\\
\phi^{1,2}=&\F{0,\Len_{1,2}}p_{1,2,4},\notag \\
\Psi^{1,2}
=&\{
(\psi^{1,2}_{1}=\F{0,\Len_{1,2}}\G{0,4}p_{1,2,3},2)\notag\\
&~
(\psi^{1,2}_{2}=\F{0,\Len_{1,2}}\G{0,4}(\lnot p_{1,2,1}),1),\notag\\
&~(\psi^{1,2}_{3}=\G{0,\Len_{1,2}}\{(\lnot p_{1,2,3}) \lor (\lnot\F{0,\Len_{1,2}}p_{1,2,1})\},1)
\},\notag
\\ % r はready
\phi^{1,3}=&\F{0,\Len_{1,3}}p_{1,3,6},\notag \\
\Psi^{1,3}
=&\{
(\psi^{1,3}_{1}=\F{0,\Len_{1,3}}p_{1,3,4}, 2),~
(\psi^{1,3}_{2}=(\G{4,6}\lnot p_{1,3,5}, 1),\notag \\&~
(\psi^{1,3}_{3}=(\F{0,\Len_{1,3}}(\G{0,3}p_{1,3,2}), 2),\notag \\&~
(\psi^{1,3}_{4}=(\lnot p_{1,3,5})\U{0,5}p_{1,3,4}, 1)
\} .
\notag
\end{align}
%
Then, a hard constraint $\phi^{1,i_2,i_3}$ and a set of pairs of a soft constraint and its weight $\Psi^{1,i_2,i_3}$ for each $G_{1,i_2,i_3}$ are as follows, respectively.

 .\notag
\end{align}

%
\subsection{Results}
%
The length of execution for each TDES is given by
\begin{align*}
\Len_1 = 30,~\Len_{1,1}=15,&~\Len_{1,2}=18,~\Len_{1,3}=20,
\\
\Len_{1,1,1} = 12,~\Len_{1,2,1}=15,&~\Len_{1,3,1}=20,~\Len_{1,3,2}=20.

We compute executions of the TDESs at the level 3 for each $\kappa\in K$.
Then, we compute executions of the TDESs at the level 2 for each $\lambda\in\Lambda^2$.

In the following, we compute an execution of $G$ as a plan with $\lambda^1=(0.1,0.1)$.
From the result of execution, the path plan of robot is shown in shown in \rfig{p:result}, and satisfied soft constraints, the sum of weights of them and completed its lower-level tasks are in Table \ref{tab:p}.

%When $\mu=0.1$, all soft constraints are satisfied, and tasks determined by the executions of $G_1$, $G_2$, and $G_3$ are implemented.
%However, every task satisfies only the hard constraint with the minimum required time and do not implemented any bottom-level tasks. 
%On the other hand, when $\mu=0.5$, satisfied soft constraints are $\psi_1$ and $\psi_4$ and tasks determined by $G_1$ and $G_3$.
%Since the execution with $\mu=0.5$ focuses on the  implementation of tasks is  more than that with $\mu=0.1$
%Since the implementation of tasks is as important as the satisfaction of soft constraints when $\mu = 0.5$, the task determined by $\pi_3(J_{\lambda_3})$ is implemented.

The robot stays at $s_{10,act}$ between [\tick] and [\tick] and implements the task determined by $\pi_{}$ and $\pi_{}$.
Then, the robot moves to $s_{34,act}$.

\section{efficiency of our method(kari)}
%
In this section, we consider(confirm) the efficiency of our proposed method.
We consider three (cases of a) three-level HTDES $\mathcal{G}_1$, $\mathcal{G}_2$, $\mathcal{G}_3$, and $\mathcal{G}_4$.
$\mathcal{G}_i$ for all $i=[1,~4]$ have one top-level TDES $G$.
In $\mathcal{G}_i$ for $i=[1,~4]$, there are one, one, two, and two middle-level TDESs $G_i$, and one, two, three and four bottom-level TDESs, respectively.
We introduce TDESs of $\mathcal{G}_i$ for $i=[1,~4]$ as follows.

In every TDES of each HTDES, there are four states and transitions between pairs of states that are different from each other.
We define the initial state and the final state states, then the two states other than the initial state and the final state are defined as refined states.
There is a transition from the final state to the final state, called \textit{self transition}.
The unit time of the top-level TDES, middle-level TDESs, and bottom-level TDESs are given by 40, 20, and 10, respectively.
In the basis of the unit time of each TDES, a timer interval for the  self transition is given by $[0,\infty]$ and those for other events are given by $[1,\infty]$.
For each TDES, a hard constraint represents ``the final state  is eventually achieved''.
Additionally, soft constraints represents ``the state $s$ is eventually achieved '' where $s$ is a state of the TDES other than the initial state and the final state, and weights of all soft constraints is 1.

For comparison, we introduce a TDES $\tilde{G}_i$ corresponding to $\mathcal{G}_i$ for $i=[1,~4]$.
In $\tilde{G}_i$, two types of transitions are added.
The first is a transition from each refined state to  the initial state of the corresponding next lower-level TDES. 
The second is a transition from each final state to the refined state of the corresponding next upper-level TDES.
The unit time of every $\tilde{G}_i$ is given by 10.
Then, the timer intervals of events corresponding to these two types of transitions are given by $[0,\infty]$.
Additionally, timer intervals of events of the top-level TDES ({\sl resp.} middle-level TDESs), originally, are given by $[4,~\infty]$ ({\sl resp.} $[2,~\infty]$).
A hard constraint for $\tilde{G}_i$ is given by ``the state, which was originally the final state of the top-level TDES, is eventually achieved''.
Soft constraints represents ``states of $\tilde{G}_i$, which were not originally the initial state and the final state, are eventually achieved'' and weights of all soft constraints are 1.

We consider the computational time and the sum of weights of satisfied soft constraints.
In the hierarchical planning, ``the computational time'' represents the time that it takes to compute executions of all TDESs for all $\kappa\in K$ and $\lambda\in \Lambda$, and ``satisfied soft constraints'' means soft constraints satisfied by one of candidates determined by the upper-level plans.
Note that, in this comparison, the results of execution which it takes more than one hour to compute are invalid.
Let $K=\{1,~0.5,~0.01\}$, $\Lambda=\{(1.0,~0),~(0.33,~0.33),~(0.1,~0.1)\}$, and $\mu=0.1$. 
Then, the results are shown in Table \ref{tab:comp}.
\begin{table}[h]

$\mathcal{G}_1,~\tilde{G}_1$&25.0   & 36.9 &  6(all) &  5\\
$\mathcal{G}_2,~\tilde{G}_2$& 91.9  &  135.3&  8(all)  & 6\\

\section{Conclusion}
%

In this paper, we considered two approaches to a planning problem for a real-time system where a specification is given by an LTL$_f$ formula.
One is to relax the specification by partitioning the specification into a hard constraint and a set of pairs of a  soft constraint and its weight. 
Then, we formulated the problem with these constraints as an ILP problem.
The other approach is hierarchical planning that allows to reduce the computational costs.
For this approach, we proposed a HTDES and we especially considered a two-level HTDES that is composed of one upper level TDES and several lower level TDESs with different time-scales.
Each lower level TDES describes detailed behaviors in the corresponding state in the upper level TDES.
We proposed an algorithm of hierarchical planning where a rough plan is determined by using the upper level TDES and detailed plans are determined by using lower level TDESs.
%
It is future work to apply the proposed approaches to control of multi-agent systems.
